Apple's signature glossy 3D shading gives the glass a realistic depth and subtle reflections, while the handle appears sturdy and well-defined with smooth gradients. This emoji visually represents investigation, scrutiny, and the act of searching or examining something closely, making it an excellent tool for conveying curiosity or a need for detailed information in your digital communication on Apple devices."
