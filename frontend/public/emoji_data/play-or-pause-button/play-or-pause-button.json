  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the play or pause button emoji is a perfectly symmetrical icon with smooth, rounded corners, showcasing Apple's commitment to clean and intuitive design. The dual nature of the symbol, seamlessly integrated into a single graphic, is rendered with subtle gradients and soft lighting that enhance its tactile feel. This versatile emoji, frequently used on Apple products, represents starting, stopping, or resuming media playback and is a fundamental element of digital interaction."
