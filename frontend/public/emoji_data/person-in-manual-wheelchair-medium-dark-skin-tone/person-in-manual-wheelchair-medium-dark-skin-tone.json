The wheelchair itself is rendered with subtle shading and smooth contours, emphasizing its functional design, while the person's posture conveys a sense of active engagement and mobility. This emoji, a hallmark of Apple's inclusive design, is a powerful symbol of accessibility, independence, and diverse human experiences."
