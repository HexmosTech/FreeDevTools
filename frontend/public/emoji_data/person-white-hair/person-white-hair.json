  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person with white hair emoji presents a dignified and wise individual, characterized by gracefully styled silver-white hair that catches the light with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. The figure's gentle smile and calm posture, rendered with soft, rounded edges, convey a sense of experience, knowledge, and warmth. This emoji is frequently used to represent elders, grandparents, or anyone embodying wisdom and a long life, adding a touch of respect and affection to digital conversations."
