  "apple_vendor_description": "The vampire emoji, rendered in Apple's signature medium-light skin tone, possesses a dramatic flair with its glossy, deep red cape and immaculately styled dark hair. On Apple devices, the character's piercing gaze and subtle, almost imperceptible smile convey a sense of playful mystery and nocturnal charm. This emoji, with its polished 3D shading and realistic lighting, is perfect for conveying a spooky or sophisticated vibe in conversations."
