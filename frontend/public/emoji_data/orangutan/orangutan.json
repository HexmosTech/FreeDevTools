Color varies across platforms, ranging from orange&nbsp;to light brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This emoji is considered <a href=\"https://blog.emojipedia.org/how-the-monkey-emoji-is-racist/\">racist in some contexts</a>,&nbsp;particularly when used to disparage, insult, and abuse people with dark skin, especially Black people.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This vibrant orangutan emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a testament to Apple’s detailed character design, featuring rich, reddish-brown fur rendered with soft, inviting gradients.  Its expressive face, with gentle, intelligent eyes and a slightly rounded snout, is brought to life by Apple’s signature realistic lighting and subtle 3D shading.  The orangutan often symbolizes intelligence, playfulness, conservation efforts, or a connection to nature, making it a warm and engaging addition to digital conversations."
