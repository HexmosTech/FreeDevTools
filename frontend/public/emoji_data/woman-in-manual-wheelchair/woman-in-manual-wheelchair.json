  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman in manual wheelchair emoji presents a graceful and determined figure, rendered with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and smooth gradients. Her expression is neutral yet approachable, conveying independence and empowerment, as seen in the detailed shading that suggests realistic lighting on her clothing and the wheelchair's metallic frame. This emoji on Apple devices is a powerful symbol of accessibility and inclusion, often used to represent personal journeys, support, or to signify the presence of someone using a wheelchair."
