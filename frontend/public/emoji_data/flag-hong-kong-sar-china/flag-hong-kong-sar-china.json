Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading lends a polished, almost translucent quality to the petals, while realistic lighting highlights the delicate veins, creating a sense of national pride and distinctiveness. This emoji is often used to represent Hong Kong, its culture, or to express solidarity with its people."
