  "apple_vendor_description": "This depiction of affection on Apple devices features a man with a deep, rich dark skin tone leaning in to kiss a woman whose skin tone is not specified, creating a universally understood symbol of love. On Apple devices, the couple is rendered with soft, rounded edges and a gentle, 3D sheen that highlights their intimate gesture. The smooth gradients and subtle lighting emphasize the tenderness and connection between them, making it an ideal emoji for expressing romantic feelings."
