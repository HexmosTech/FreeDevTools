  "description": "Represents a handshake between two individuals, signifying agreement, greeting, or a deal being made. This version specifically depicts a handshake with dark skin tones.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the handshake emoji depicts two hands, rendered with Apple‚Äôs signature dark skin tone, clasped firmly together in a gesture of agreement and unity. The smooth, rounded edges and subtle 3D shading create a tactile and reassuring feel, as if you can almost feel the connection. This emoji, appearing with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting, powerfully conveys trust, collaboration, and a successful negotiation, making it a go-to for celebrating a shared understanding."
