  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman zombie emoji on Apple devices is a delightfully eerie creation, featuring a pale, slightly greenish complexion and vacant, yet expressive, eyes.  Her tattered clothing drapes with a realistic texture, enhanced by Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and subtle shadows that add to her spectral appearance. This emoji, with its touch of macabre humor and undead charm, is ideal for expressing a feeling of being overwhelmed, exhausted, or playfully spooky."
