Its face is a crisp white with bold, black numerals and hands, highlighted by realistic lighting that emphasizes its metallic casing.  This emoji, often depicted with hands pointing to an early hour, signifies waking up, reminders, or the passage of time, a familiar sight in Apple's vibrant digital interface."
