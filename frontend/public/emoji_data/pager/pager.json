  "apple_vendor_description": "Rendered with Apple's characteristic attention to detail, the pager emoji appears as a sleek, modern device with a crisp display. On Apple devices, its subtle highlights and polished casing suggest a functional, yet stylish piece of communication technology from a bygone era, often used humorously to indicate old-school communication methods or a nostalgic nod. The clean, rounded edges and clear screen are hallmarks of Apple's refined aesthetic."
