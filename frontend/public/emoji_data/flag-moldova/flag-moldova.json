  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Moldova, as seen on Apple devices, is a striking tricolor of vertical bands: cobalt blue, golden yellow, and crimson red. At its center, the national coat of arms, featuring an eagle holding a scepter and a cross, is rendered with remarkable detail and dimensionality thanks to Apple's signature glossy shading and realistic lighting. On Apple devices, this flag appears dignified and proud, with its smooth gradients and soft edges conveying a sense of national identity and heritage."
