  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Romania, as rendered on Apple devices, features three equal vertical bands of blue, yellow, and red, each stripe possessing a subtle 3D effect and smooth, realistic lighting. Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and glossy sheen give the flag a vibrant and dignified appearance, symbolizing national pride and identity. This distinctively rendered emoji is a clear and recognizable representation of Romania in digital communication."
