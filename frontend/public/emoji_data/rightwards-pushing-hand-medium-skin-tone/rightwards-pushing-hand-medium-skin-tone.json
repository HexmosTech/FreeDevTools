Apple's design imbues this emoji with a tactile feel through its glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting, making the gesture appear strong and decisive. Its soft rounded edges contribute to a friendly yet firm appearance, commonly used to signify moving forward, pushing for progress, or indicating agreement and approval."
