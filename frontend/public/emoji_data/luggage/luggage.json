  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the luggage emoji is a robust and stylish suitcase, rendered with a rich, deep color and a prominent sheen that speaks to its durable construction. Apple's characteristic 3D shading and realistic lighting give the luggage a sense of volume and texture, suggesting readiness for travel and adventure. The smooth, rounded corners and polished details make it an inviting symbol for journeys, vacations, and the excitement of exploring new destinations."
