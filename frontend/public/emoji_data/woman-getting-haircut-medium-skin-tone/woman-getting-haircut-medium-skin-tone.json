  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman getting a haircut emoji features a person with medium skin tone looking forward with a neutral expression, as a pair of shiny scissors expertly snips at her hair. The Apple design language imbues the scene with a sense of gentle precision, showcasing soft rounded edges on the scissors and hair strands, all rendered with smooth gradients and realistic lighting. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, perfectly captures the moment of transformation and self-care, often used to convey a fresh start, a new look, or a trip to the salon."
