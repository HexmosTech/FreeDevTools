The central emblem, the Allah symbol, is precisely detailed in a deep red against the white band, while the Kufic script along the green and red borders adds a refined touch. This official flag emoji on Apple devices signifies national pride, cultural identity, and is used in contexts related to Iran, its people, or current events."
