  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the love hotel emoji depicts a stylized, modern building with a prominent pink heart symbol adorning its façade, bathed in soft, ambient lighting. Its rounded edges and smooth, glossy finish lend it a playful yet slightly suggestive appearance, typical of Apple’s illustrative style. This emoji is commonly used to symbolize romance, relationships, or a discreet getaway, often with a touch of playful innuendo in digital communication."
