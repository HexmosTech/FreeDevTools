  "description": "An ear with a light skin tone and a visible hearing aid, symbolizing hearing assistance or a hearing impairment. Can be used to represent auditory challenges or the use of assistive devices.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the ear with a hearing aid emoji showcases a finely detailed, light skin tone with subtle shading and soft, rounded edges that are characteristic of Apple‚Äôs design language. The hearing aid itself is rendered with a smooth, almost matte finish, subtly integrated into the ear, conveying a sense of accessibility and modern technology. This emoji is a thoughtful representation of hearing augmentation and can be used to express personal experiences, empathy, or to signify support for those with hearing challenges, all within the polished aesthetic of Apple emojis."
