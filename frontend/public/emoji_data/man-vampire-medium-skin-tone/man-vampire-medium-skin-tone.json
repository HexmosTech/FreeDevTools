  "apple_vendor_description": "The man vampire emoji on Apple devices is a striking figure, with a medium skin tone that adds to his mysterious aura. His attire, often a cape with a deep, rich lining, is depicted with Apple's characteristic 3D shading and realistic lighting, creating a sense of dramatic flair. The subtle tilt of his head and the hint of a smile, combined with the smooth, rounded edges of his features, make this emoji a playfully spooky and engaging choice for expressing themes of fantasy, the night, or even a touch of playful darkness."
