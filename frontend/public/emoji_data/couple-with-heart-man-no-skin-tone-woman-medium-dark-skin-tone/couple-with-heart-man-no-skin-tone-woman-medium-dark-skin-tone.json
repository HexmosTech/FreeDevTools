  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s rendering of a couple with a heart, featuring a man with a standard skin tone and a woman with a medium-dark skin tone, beautifully captures a romantic bond through its signature design. The emoji’s glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients on Apple devices give the figures a lifelike and tender presence.  The central heart, rendered with soft rounded edges and gentle highlights, powerfully symbolizes love, partnership, and affection between individuals."
