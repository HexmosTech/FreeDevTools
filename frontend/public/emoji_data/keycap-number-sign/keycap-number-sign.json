  "apple_vendor_description": "The number sign, or pound symbol, on Apple devices is rendered with a bold, geometric presence, featuring a distinct dark gray keycap with crisp, white lettering. Its smooth, rounded edges and subtle 3D shading give it a tactile feel, as if pressed from a real keyboard. This emoji on Apple devices is commonly used to denote hashtags, indicate a sequence or order, or in digital contexts as a placeholder for a number.",
