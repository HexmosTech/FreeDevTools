  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Tajikistan, as depicted on Apple devices, is a crisp and vibrant rendition of its national symbol, featuring bold horizontal stripes and a detailed crown. The three prominent stripes – red at the top, followed by white, and then green at the bottom – are rendered with a subtle sheen and soft, rounded edges, characteristic of Apple's design language, ensuring clarity and visual appeal. The central emblem, a stylized golden crown topped with seven stars, is meticulously detailed and pops with realistic lighting, symbolizing Tajik sovereignty and unity, and is instantly recognizable on any Apple device."
