Depicted as a green <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus\">tyrannosaur</a> standing on its hind lefts facing left, often with a textured back, sharp teeth, and clawed toes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May be used to represent various dinosaurs, including raptors. See also <a href=\"/sauropod/\">🦕 Sauropod</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May also be used to call a person a dinosaur, i.e. imply that they are old-fashioned or out-of-touch with modern sentiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/google/android-8.0/t-rex/\">Google&rsquo;s</a> T-rex used to look somewhat like&nbsp;a velociraptor, though the design has since changed. <a href=\"/samsung/experience-9.0/t-rex/\">Samsung&rsquo;s</a> T-Rex was previously red, <a href=\"/microsoft/windows-10-fall-creators-update/t-rex/\">Microsoft&#39;s</a> brown, and&nbsp;<a href=\"/facebook/2.1/t-rex/\">Facebook&rsquo;s</a> only a green head with open jaws.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The T-Rex emoji on Apple devices is a formidable yet stylized creature, designed with Apple’s signature bold outlines and glossy 3D shading that give it a playful, toy-like quality. Its rounded form and bright, engaging colors make this prehistoric giant approachable, while the subtle highlights suggest a polished, tactile surface. This iconic dinosaur, as seen on Apple’s vibrant displays, often evokes themes of power, the past, or a sense of playful, primal energy."
