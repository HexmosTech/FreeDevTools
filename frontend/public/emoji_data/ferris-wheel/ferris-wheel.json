Apple's signature glossy 3D shading creates a sense of depth and movement, with individual cabins catching the light and appearing ready for a ride. Its smooth gradients and realistic lighting evoke the excitement of a fairground or a panoramic view, symbolizing joy, adventure, and shared experiences in communication."
