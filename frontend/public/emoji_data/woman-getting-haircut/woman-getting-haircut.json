  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman getting a haircut emoji depicts a serene individual with smooth, rounded features and a gentle expression, seated while a stylist's scissors are subtly implied near her hair. Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and soft gradients create a sense of calm and personal care, highlighting the smooth texture of her hair. This emoji is commonly used to represent self-care, transformation, a fresh start, or the simple act of visiting a salon."
