  "apple_vendor_description": "The supervillain emoji on Apple devices sports a striking, almost theatrical design, with a medium-light skin tone that accentuates its menacing features. Its iconic mask, often rendered with a glossy sheen and sharp, defined edges, is a hallmark of Apple's detailed emoji artistry. This character, brimming with dark charisma and a hint of sinister glee, is perfect for conveying playful mischief, dramatic flair, or a sense of overwhelming power in digital conversations."
