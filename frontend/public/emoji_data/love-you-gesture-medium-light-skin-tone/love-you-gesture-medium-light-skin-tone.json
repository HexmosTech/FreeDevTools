  "apple_vendor_description": "This expressive love you gesture emoji, rendered with medium-light skin tone on Apple devices, beautifully captures the sentiment of affection. The hand is positioned to form the 'I love you' sign, with thumb, index, and pinky fingers extended, a design consistent with Apple's clear and recognizable glyphs.  The smooth, rounded edges and subtle lighting on the fingers lend a gentle warmth, making it a sincere and heartfelt way to communicate love and appreciation."
