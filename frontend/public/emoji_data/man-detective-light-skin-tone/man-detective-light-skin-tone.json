  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the man detective emoji for light skin tones features a sharp, inquisitive gaze and a classic trench coat, all brought to life with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and precise lighting. The details, like the subtle texture of his hat and the confident tilt of his head, are rendered with exceptional clarity on Apple devices, evoking a sense of mystery, investigation, and keen observation. This emoji is perfect for communicating a feeling of uncovering secrets, solving problems, or embarking on a search."
