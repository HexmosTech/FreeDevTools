Apple's signature smooth gradients and glossy 3D shading give it a slightly raised, tactile quality, as if it were a perfectly crafted tile. Its soft rounded edges ensure a friendly and approachable aesthetic, making it ideal for conveying concepts related to nature, growth, or simply as a vibrant block of color in digital communication on Apple platforms."
