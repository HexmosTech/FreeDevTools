  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman with curly hair emoji presents a vibrant and dynamic hairstyle, rendered with Apple’s signature soft rounded edges and realistic lighting. Her hair cascades in rich, voluminous curls, appearing almost tangible thanks to the glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients that create a lively sense of movement. This emoji beautifully captures a sense of individuality and natural beauty, often used to represent women with curly hair or to convey a feeling of spirited confidence in digital communication."
