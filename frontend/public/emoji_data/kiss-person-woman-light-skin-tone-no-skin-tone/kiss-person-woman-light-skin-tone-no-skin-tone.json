  "description": "Represents a romantic kiss between a woman with a lighter skin tone and a man with a default, non-specified skin tone. It signifies affection, love, and intimacy.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this depiction of a woman blowing a kiss is rendered with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and a warm, inviting glow. Her lips are slightly pursed, colored in a gentle rosy hue with glossy 3D shading that catches the light, conveying a sweet and affectionate gesture. The subtle gradients in her skin tone and the delicate expression make this emoji on Apple devices a charming way to send love, air kisses, or express fondness in digital communications."
