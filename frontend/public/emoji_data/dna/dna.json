  "apple_vendor_description": "The DNA emoji on Apple devices showcases a meticulously detailed double helix structure, rendered with a subtle metallic sheen and smooth, flowing curves. Apple's 3D shading and realistic lighting give the strands a sense of depth and molecular complexity, making it appear both scientific and elegantly designed. This emoji is commonly used to symbolize genetics, science, research, or fundamental aspects of life and identity in digital communication."
