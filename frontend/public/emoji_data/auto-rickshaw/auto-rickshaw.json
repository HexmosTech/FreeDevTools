  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the auto-rickshaw emoji presents a cheerful and colorful rendition of this iconic three-wheeled vehicle, often depicted in a bright yellow or red.  Apple's signature glossy 3D shading gives the vehicle a polished, almost toy-like appearance, emphasizing its rounded forms and smooth surfaces.  This emoji evokes a sense of adventure, travel, and perhaps a touch of nostalgia, commonly used when discussing journeys or transportation in bustling locales."
