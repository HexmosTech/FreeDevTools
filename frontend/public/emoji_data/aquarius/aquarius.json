Apple's smooth gradients and soft rounded edges give the wave a gentle, ethereal quality with subtle highlights that suggest movement and depth. This emoji is commonly used on Apple devices to represent individuals born under the Aquarius sign, or to convey themes of innovation, individuality, and forward-thinking ideas."
