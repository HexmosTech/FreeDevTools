The stars of the cross possess a gentle luminescence, hinting at the realistic lighting Apple applies to its emoji.  This emoji offers a distinct visual representation of the Polynesian island nation, ideal for geographical references, cultural exchanges, or expressing a connection to Tokelau with Apple's characteristic visual integrity."
