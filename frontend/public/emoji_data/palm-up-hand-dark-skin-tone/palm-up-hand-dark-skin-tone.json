The palm is slightly cupped, with soft, rounded edges and a smooth gradient that suggests a realistic, supple texture. Apple's characteristic realistic lighting creates a subtle sheen, conveying openness, generosity, and a willingness to offer or receive. This emoji is frequently used to express offering help, seeking something, or simply conveying an open and receptive attitude."
