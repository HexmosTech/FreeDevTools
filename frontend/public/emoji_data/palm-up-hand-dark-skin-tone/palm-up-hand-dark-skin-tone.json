  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the palm-up hand emoji with a dark skin tone is rendered with a gentle, inviting gesture. The palm is slightly cupped, with soft, rounded edges and a smooth gradient that suggests a realistic, supple texture. Apple's characteristic realistic lighting creates a subtle sheen, conveying openness, generosity, and a willingness to offer or receive. This emoji is frequently used to express offering help, seeking something, or simply conveying an open and receptive attitude."
