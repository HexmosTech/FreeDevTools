  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person in a steamy room emoji features a medium-dark skinned figure enveloped in a cloud of soft, translucent steam. Apple‚Äôs signature 3D shading creates a sense of depth, making the steam appear ethereal and the figure subtly outlined, evoking a feeling of relaxation and rejuvenation. This emoji is perfect for communicating a sense of calm, peace, or a luxurious spa experience, as rendered with Apple's characteristic attention to detail."
