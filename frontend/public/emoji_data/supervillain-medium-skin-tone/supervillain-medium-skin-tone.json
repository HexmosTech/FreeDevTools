  "description": "Represents a supervillain with a medium skin tone, often used to convey a sense of evil, power, or a dramatic, over-the-top persona.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the supervillain emoji with a medium skin tone embodies menacing charm with its sharp features and dramatic shadows, characteristic of Apple's signature 3D rendering. A deep, almost regal cape billows behind, its folds catching the light with smooth gradients, while the mask offers a mysterious yet determined expression. This emoji on Apple devices is perfect for conveying a sense of playful mischief, overwhelming power, or a darkly humorous acknowledgment of a formidable task."
