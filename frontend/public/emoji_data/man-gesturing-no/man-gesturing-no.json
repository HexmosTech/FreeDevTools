  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man gesturing 'no' presents a clear and emphatic stance with a subtly rounded face and a determined expression. His arm is raised with an open palm, a universal sign for negation, all depicted with Apple's hallmark 3D shading and smooth gradients that give him a solid, approachable appearance. The realistic lighting accentuates the gesture, conveying polite refusal, disagreement, or a firm boundary in a friendly and easily understood manner."
