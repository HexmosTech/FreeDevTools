He's depicted wearing a classic trench coat and fedora, with subtle shading and realistic lighting that give the attire a tangible feel, characteristic of Apple's 3D design.  The focused expression and the overall polished look convey intelligence, problem-solving, and the pursuit of clues, making it perfect for discussions involving investigation or deduction."
