  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the deaf woman emoji with medium skin tone is depicted with a gentle, thoughtful expression, her hand gracefully positioned near her ear to signify hearing. Apple’s signature soft rounded edges and subtle 3D shading give her a warm, approachable appearance. This emoji conveys understanding, communication beyond words, or the experience of hearing impairment on Apple devices."
