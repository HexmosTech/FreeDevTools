  "apple_vendor_description": "The biohazard symbol on Apple devices is rendered with a striking, cautionary yellow and black color scheme, adhering to its universally recognized warning. Apple's design language imbues it with a polished, almost three-dimensional appearance, thanks to its glossy shading and clear, defined lines that emphasize its critical nature. This emoji is used to signify danger, biological risks, or hazardous materials, conveying a sense of urgency and awareness in digital contexts."
