The soft, rounded edges of the figure and the subtle texture of the fabric contribute to its refined and approachable appearance, reflecting Apple's inclusive design language. This emoji is a positive representation of cultural identity and is used to express solidarity, represent individuals, or add a personal touch to communications on Apple products."
