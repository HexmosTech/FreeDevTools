  "apple_vendor_description": "The thong sandal emoji on Apple devices is a stylish representation of summer footwear, characterized by Apple’s characteristic glossy finish and subtle 3D depth. Its smooth, rounded straps and the suggestion of a sole are rendered with realistic lighting, making it look both fashionable and tactile. This emoji is perfect for conveying vacation vibes, beach plans, or a casual, relaxed mood in your digital communications on Apple devices."
