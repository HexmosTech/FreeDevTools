  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's dodo emoji renders this extinct bird with a plump, endearing body and a distinctive curved beak, colored in gentle earthy tones. The design, characteristic of Apple's approach, features subtle 3D shading and soft, rounded forms, giving it a friendly and somewhat nostalgic appearance. It serves as a unique symbol for extinction, history, or a quirky, memorable reference in digital communication."
