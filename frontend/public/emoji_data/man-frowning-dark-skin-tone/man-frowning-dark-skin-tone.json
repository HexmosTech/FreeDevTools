  "apple_vendor_description": "This Apple emoji presents a man with a deep, rich skin tone, his brow furrowed with a clear expression of displeasure or disappointment. On Apple devices, the shading and lighting are expertly applied to emphasize the downturned corners of his mouth and the slight tension in his forehead, conveying a universally understood feeling of unhappiness. It's a powerful tool for expressing frustration, disagreement, or sadness in a concise, visual way."
