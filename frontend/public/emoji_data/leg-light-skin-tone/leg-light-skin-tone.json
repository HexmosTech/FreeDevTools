  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the leg emoji with a light skin tone is rendered with a smooth, natural curve and a subtle, realistic sheen that emphasizes its form. Apple's expert 3D shading gives it a sense of volume and soft definition, while the rounded edges ensure it looks inviting and not sharp. This emoji is often used to represent movement, walking, dancing, or simply the act of standing, conveying a sense of physical presence or action in digital messages."
