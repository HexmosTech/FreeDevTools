  "apple_vendor_description": "The speak no evil monkey emoji on Apple devices is depicted with its hands covering its mouth, embodying a sense of discretion and quiet observation. Apple's rendering gives the monkey a soft, rounded form and a gentle expression, with smooth gradients that lend it a friendly, approachable appearance. This emoji signifies a commitment to not speaking ill of others, maintaining silence, or a playful refusal to gossip, all presented with the charming visual style of Apple's emoji set."
