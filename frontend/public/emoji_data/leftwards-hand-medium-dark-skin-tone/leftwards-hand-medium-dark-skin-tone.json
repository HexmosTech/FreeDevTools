  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the leftwards hand emoji with a medium-dark skin tone is depicted with a clear, defined gesture, rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and realistic lighting to give it a tactile feel. The soft rounded edges of the fingers and palm ensure a friendly and approachable appearance, signifying direction, pointing, or indicating a movement to the left. This emoji is a straightforward way to guide attention or indicate a specific location or action."
