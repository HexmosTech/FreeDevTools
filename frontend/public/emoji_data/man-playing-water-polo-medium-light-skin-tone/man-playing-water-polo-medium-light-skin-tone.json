He's depicted mid-throw, his form sculpted by realistic lighting that emphasizes muscle definition and the splash of water around him.  The soft, rounded edges of his athletic build and the glistening droplets highlight the vibrant energy of the sport, often used to convey enthusiasm for swimming, competition, or water-based activities."
