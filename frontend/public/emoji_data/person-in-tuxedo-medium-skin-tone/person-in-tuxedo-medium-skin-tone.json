  "description": "A person dressed in a formal tuxedo, often associated with special occasions, elegance, and sophistication. The medium skin tone indicates a specific representation.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this dapper figure is depicted in a sharp tuxedo with a crisp white shirt and a perfectly tied black bow tie, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. The medium skin tone is subtly shaded to convey a smooth, realistic complexion, while the overall posture suggests refined elegance and readiness for a formal occasion. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is perfect for conveying sophistication, celebration, or a sense of being dressed to impress."
