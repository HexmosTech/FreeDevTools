  "description": "A hand with the thumb and index finger pinched together, with a dark skin tone. Often used to indicate a small amount, emphasis, or a gesture of 'just a little'.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The pinched fingers emoji, presented in Apple's rich dark skin tone, captures a nuanced gesture with remarkable detail and realism. On Apple devices, this emoji showcases a finely sculpted hand with the thumb and index finger brought together, conveying a sense of 'just a little bit' or a subtle emphasis. The glossy finish and precise lighting on the fingertips, characteristic of Apple's design language, give it a tactile quality that enhances its expressive power, perfect for communicating modesty, precision, or a hint of playful skepticism."
