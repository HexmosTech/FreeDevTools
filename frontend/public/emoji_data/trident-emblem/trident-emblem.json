  "apple_vendor_description": "The trident emblem on Apple devices is rendered with a strong, metallic sheen, evoking the power and authority of Poseidon's mythical weapon. Its three prongs are sharp and defined, catching the light with subtle highlights that showcase Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. This emoji, with its confident and commanding presence on Apple devices, often signifies strength, authority, or a connection to the sea and its mythology."
