  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman rowing boat emoji showcases a determined individual with a light skin tone, her arms powerfully extended as she propels a sleek, modern boat through calm waters.  The design features Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, giving the oars and the vessel a realistic, tactile feel, while smooth gradients capture the subtle play of light on her determined expression and the surrounding environment. This emoji beautifully conveys themes of adventure, progress, and overcoming challenges, often used to signify embarking on a new journey or working towards a common goal with focused effort."
