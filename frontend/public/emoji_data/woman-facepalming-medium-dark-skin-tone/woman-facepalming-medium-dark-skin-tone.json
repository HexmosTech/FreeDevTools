  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman facepalming emoji, presented in Apple's rich medium-dark skin tone, captures a moment of exasperation with remarkable expressiveness. On Apple devices, the slight curve of her hand against her forehead and the subtle tilt of her head are rendered with smooth, realistic lighting, conveying a universal feeling of disbelief or frustration. This emoji, with its characteristic Apple polish and rounded edges, is perfect for communicating those 'can't believe this is happening' moments in digital conversations."
