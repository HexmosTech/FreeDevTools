  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's right-hand arrow curving upwards is a dynamic and polished symbol, rendered with a vibrant blue color and a sleek, glossy finish that exemplifies Apple's 3D design language. The smooth gradient and crisp edges on Apple devices give it a sense of upward momentum and progression, making it ideal for indicating growth, improvement, or moving forward in a positive direction."
