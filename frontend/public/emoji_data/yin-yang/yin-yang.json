  "description": "<p>The circular symbol frequently used to represent the concepts of yin and yang (also yinyang or yin-yang).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yin and yang symbol (or taijitu) shows a balance between two opposite but interconnected forces with a portion of the opposite element in each section.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The yin-yang emoji on Apple devices is a beautifully balanced circular symbol, rendered with a glossy, almost ceramic-like finish and smooth, contrasting gradients. Its perfect symmetry and the way light plays across its surface are characteristic of Apple's meticulous 3D design. This emoji embodies duality, harmony, and the interconnectedness of opposing forces, often used to signify balance or philosophical concepts."
