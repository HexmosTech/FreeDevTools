  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's lab coat emoji presents a crisp, clean symbol of scientific endeavor, rendered with a subtle sheen and soft, rounded folds that reflect Apple's commitment to realistic lighting and 3D depth. The smooth white fabric, subtly shaded, evokes a sense of professionalism and discovery characteristic of Apple's polished aesthetic. This emoji is commonly used to represent science, research, medicine, or any endeavor requiring analytical thought and innovation on Apple devices."
