The letters 'Z' are presented in a bold, slightly rounded font, characteristic of Apple‚Äôs clean design aesthetic, and are subtly shaded to give them a gentle 3D presence. Soft, wispy lines emanate from the letters, visually representing a deep slumber or the quiet hum of sleep, conveying a sense of rest and relaxation with a touch of whimsy."
