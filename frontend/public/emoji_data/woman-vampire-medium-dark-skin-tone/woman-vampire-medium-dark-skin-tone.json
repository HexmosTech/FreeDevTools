  "apple_vendor_description": "This striking woman vampire emoji, as seen on Apple devices, boasts a medium-dark skin tone and is rendered with Apple's signature dramatic lighting and glossy 3D shading, giving her an alluring and slightly mysterious aura. Her attire is detailed with soft curves and realistic textures, and her expression, while perhaps a touch playful, hints at the supernatural. She embodies the mystique of the night and the allure of the vampire mythos in Apple communications."
