  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, Mount Fuji is depicted as a majestic, snow-capped peak rising serenely against a clear blue sky, rendered with Apple's signature realistic lighting and smooth gradients. The iconic conical shape is given a subtle 3D depth with soft rounded edges, making it a beautiful and instantly recognizable symbol. This emoji on Apple devices evokes a sense of awe, natural beauty, and iconic Japanese culture, often used to represent travel, nature, or Japan itself."
