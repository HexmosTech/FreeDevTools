  "description": "Represents a romantic relationship between two women, with the person emoji indicating a gender identity that may not be exclusively female, and the skin tone specifying medium-light.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This couple emoji on Apple devices features two figures embracing, with one person distinctly rendered as a woman, positioned beside a person of no specific skin tone indicated, all bathed in Apple's signature realistic lighting and soft rounded edges. A vibrant, glossy red heart hovers between them, symbolizing deep affection, partnership, and love with a warm, inviting glow. It's a beautiful way to express romantic connection or strong familial bonds in messages shared on Apple devices."
