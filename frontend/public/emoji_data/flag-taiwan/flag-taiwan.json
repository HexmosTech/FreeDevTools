  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Taiwan on Apple devices is depicted with vibrant, true-to-life colors, showcasing the rich red field and the iconic blue canton with a white sun. Apple’s characteristic glossy finish and precise rendering of light and shadow give the flag a dynamic, almost fluttering appearance.
