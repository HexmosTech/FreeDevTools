  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s depiction of grapes is a delightful cluster of plump, juicy berries, rendered with the signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting that makes them appear almost edible on Apple devices. Each grape is perfectly round with a smooth, lustrous surface and subtle color variations, hinting at ripeness and freshness, typical of Apple's attention to detail. This emoji evokes feelings of abundance, sweetness, and celebration, often used to represent food, nature, or a delightful occasion in digital communication."
