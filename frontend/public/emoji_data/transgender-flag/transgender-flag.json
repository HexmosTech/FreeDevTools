  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the transgender flag emoji unfurls with crisp, clean lines, its distinct pattern of pale blue, pink, and white stripes rendered with a subtle sheen that speaks to Apple's polished design language.  Each stripe is precisely defined, with soft, rounded edges contributing to its friendly yet respectful presentation.  This important symbol, embodying gender identity and pride, is used to show support, solidarity, and recognition within the LGBTQ+ community."
