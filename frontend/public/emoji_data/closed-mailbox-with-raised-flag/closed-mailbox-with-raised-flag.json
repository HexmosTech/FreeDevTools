  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the closed mailbox emoji stands upright with a cheerful, slightly angled posture, its red flag jauntily raised, signifying communication and an impending delivery. Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading renders its metallic surface with realistic reflections, highlighting its smooth, rounded edges and clean white body. This emoji on Apple devices evokes anticipation, the act of sending or receiving mail, and the simple joy of a completed task."
