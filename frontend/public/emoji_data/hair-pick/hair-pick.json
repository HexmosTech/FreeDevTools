  "apple_vendor_description": "The hair pick emoji on Apple devices is rendered with a tactile appearance, featuring smooth, rounded prongs and a sturdy handle, all imbued with Apple’s characteristic realistic lighting and subtle shading. Its clean lines and polished finish suggest both utility and style, representing the act of grooming, self-care, or a nod to cultural pride and personal expression. This emoji is a subtle yet impactful addition to Apple's diverse emoji collection."
