Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and soft rounded edges lend a dignified and somewhat mysterious aura to the depiction, with subtle lighting adding to its refined appearance. This emoji is often used to represent cultural traditions, weddings, or instances where veiling is a part of an event, bringing a unique visual element to conversations on Apple devices."
