  "apple_vendor_description": "The left-right arrow emoji on Apple devices is a bold, clear indicator of directionality and choice. Rendered with Apple's characteristic sharp lines and smooth, matte finish, it appears sturdy and definitive, with subtle shading that gives it a slight 3D presence. This versatile emoji, symbolizing movement in both directions, agreement, or a balanced perspective, is a fundamental tool for navigation and communication within Apple's digital interfaces."
