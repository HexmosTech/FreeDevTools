  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's high-voltage emoji crackles with energy, featuring a bold yellow lightning bolt against a stark background, rendered with striking realism. The design on Apple devices employs sharp, dynamic lines and a vibrant, almost electric glow, enhanced by glossy 3D shading that suggests immense power. This emoji powerfully conveys urgency, excitement, danger, or a surge of intense energy, making it a potent visual exclamation."
