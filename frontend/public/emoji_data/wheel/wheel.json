  "apple_vendor_description": "The wheel emoji on Apple devices is rendered as a classic, robust wheel, often appearing with a dark, slightly metallic rim and a prominent central hub. Apple’s characteristic glossy 3D shading gives it a sense of depth and solidity, making it look ready for motion. This emoji symbolizes transportation, progress, innovation, or a crucial component of a larger system, evoking a feeling of forward momentum and mechanical integrity."
