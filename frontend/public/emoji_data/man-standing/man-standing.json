  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man standing emoji features a figure with a confident and upright posture, rendered with Apple's trademark soft rounded edges and refined 3D shading. Realistic lighting subtly defines his form and clothing, giving him a polished and approachable look. This emoji on Apple devices, with its simple yet complete presentation, is often used to represent a male individual, to signify presence, or to indicate a person taking a stance or ready for action."
