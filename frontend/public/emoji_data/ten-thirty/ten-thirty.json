  "apple_vendor_description": "This clock emoji on Apple devices precisely shows the time as 10:30, with a classic analog face and finely detailed hands rendered in gleaming metallic tones. Apple’s signature realistic lighting highlights the polished surface of the clock face and the sharp, slender hands, giving it a sophisticated and tangible feel.  The clear, legible numerals and smooth, rounded edges contribute to its overall clarity, making it an unambiguous way to convey a specific time for meetings or events."
