  "description": "A person in a suit, appearing to levitate or float, with a medium-light skin tone. Often used to express a sense of surprise, elation, freedom, or a fantastical situation.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person in a suit levitating emoji, depicted with a medium-light skin tone, appears dapper and empowered. Apple's distinctive glossy 3D shading and precise lighting create a polished, almost buoyant effect, with the suit's fabric appearing crisp and the figure seemingly defying gravity. This emoji, with its smooth, refined edges, is often used humorously to represent feeling on top of the world, a sudden success, or a confident, carefree attitude."
