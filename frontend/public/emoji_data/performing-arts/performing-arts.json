Each mask boasts a smooth gradient, with the comedic mask sporting a cheerful, upturned smile and the tragic mask a somber frown, all framed by soft, rounded edges.  This emoji, with its rich, jewel-toned coloring and realistic lighting, beautifully encapsulates the essence of theater, drama, and the performing arts, often used to signify an interest in or engagement with these expressive fields."
