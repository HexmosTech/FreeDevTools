  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the nail polish emoji showcases a vibrant, glossy bottle with a rich, opaque liquid spilling slightly from its tip, rendered with Apple's signature 3D shading and smooth gradients. The bottle's rounded form and the reflective quality of the polish itself create a luxurious and appealing aesthetic. This emoji is commonly used to express a love for beauty, fashion, self-care, or to indicate that one is getting their nails done. Its bright, cheerful presentation on Apple devices makes it a popular choice for adding a touch of glamour or personal style to messages."
