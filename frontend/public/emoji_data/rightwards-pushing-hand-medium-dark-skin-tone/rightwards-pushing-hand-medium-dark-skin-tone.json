  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rightwards pushing hand emoji, presented with a medium-dark skin tone, is rendered with smooth, realistic lighting and a subtle 3D effect, making it appear almost tangible. The hand is shown with fingers slightly curled, conveying a sense of gentle but firm forward momentum. On Apple devices, this emoji is commonly used to indicate 'stop,' 'hold on,' or to signal a clear boundary, offering a polite yet direct way to manage conversation flow or express disagreement without explicit words."
