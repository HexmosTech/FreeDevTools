  "apple_vendor_description": "This emoji, rendered with Apple's signature depth and soft, rounded edges, depicts a woman with a medium-dark skin tone leaning in for a kiss, her lips slightly puckered and her eyes closed in a moment of tender affection. On Apple devices, the realistic lighting and subtle 3D shading give her a gentle warmth, conveying a sense of intimacy, romance, or a sweet goodnight. Its presence in digital communication speaks to heartfelt goodbyes and affectionate gestures."
