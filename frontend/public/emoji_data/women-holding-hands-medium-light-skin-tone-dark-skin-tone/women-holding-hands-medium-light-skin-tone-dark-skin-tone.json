  "apple_vendor_description": "Showcasing inclusivity on Apple devices, the women holding hands emoji features two distinct skin tones: one medium-light and the other dark, both rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges. Their hands are gently clasped, with subtle highlights and shadows that give them a tangible, warm feel. This emoji on Apple devices is a powerful symbol of friendship, solidarity, partnership, or romantic love between women, celebrating diverse relationships."
