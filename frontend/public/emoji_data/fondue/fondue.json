  "apple_vendor_description": "The fondue emoji on Apple devices presents a bubbling pot of rich, golden cheese, complete with a dipping bread cube, all rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. The texture of the cheese looks wonderfully melty and inviting, while the pot has a polished, warm appearance, suggesting comfort and shared enjoyment. This emoji beautifully embodies the cozy, communal experience of sharing a delicious fondue, perfect for expressing warmth, hospitality, or a desire for comfort food on Apple devices."
