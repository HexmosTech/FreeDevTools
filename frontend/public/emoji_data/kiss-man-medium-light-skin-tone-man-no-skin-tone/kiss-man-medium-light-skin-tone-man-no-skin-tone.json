  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji depicts two men sharing a tender kiss, rendered with Apple’s signature smooth gradients and realistic lighting. The medium-light skin tone of one man is subtly shaded, while the other figure, without a specific skin tone, is defined by soft, rounded edges that convey a sense of unity and affection. This emoji on Apple devices beautifully captures a moment of romantic connection and personal expression, often used to signify love and partnership."
