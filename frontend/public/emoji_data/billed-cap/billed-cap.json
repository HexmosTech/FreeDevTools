  "description": "<p>A plain soft hat with a rounded crown and a stiff bill. Most often shown in a shade of blue and displayed at an angle to clearly display its outwards- protruding bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regularly associated with the slang term &quot;capping&quot;, meaning &quot;lying&quot;. Responding to a message with a single 🧢 emoji is viewable as&nbsp;an accusation of lying (&ldquo;cap&rdquo;)&nbsp;while stating &quot;no 🧢&quot;&nbsp;(&quot;no cap&quot;) is intended to emphasize the&nbsp;truthfulness of a statement.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's billed cap emoji is a sleek, stylish accessory rendered with exceptional attention to detail, featuring a prominent brim and a rounded crown that appears to be made of a smooth, matte fabric. On Apple devices, the realistic lighting and subtle shading create a convincing sense of dimension, highlighting the soft rounded edges of the cap’s form. Whether used to signify casual style, outdoor activities, or a sense of laid-back confidence, this emoji, with its clean lines and understated elegance, embodies the sophisticated design language found across Apple products."
