  "description": "<p>A hand holding a <a href=\"/pen/\" title=\"🖊 Lower Left Ballpoint Pen\">pen</a> or <a href=\"/pencil/\" title=\"✏️ Pencil\">pencil</a> and writing. Most often shown as holding either a blue or black pen, though Microsoft&#39;s design has a red pen. LG&#39;s design displays a left hand, while all other platforms show&nbsp;a right hand. Used broadly to represent writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also used between words to show that a lesson is being learned and to indicate someone is taking notes. For example, <em>✍️look✍️both✍️ways✍️before✍️you✍️cross✍️the✍️street</em>. This use&nbsp;was popularized in <a href=\"https://blog.emojipedia.org/what-happens-in-the-tiktok-comments/\">TikTok comments</a>. It uses the established practice of placing emojis between words for emphasis. Possibly influenced by the emphatic use of <a href=\"/clapping-hands/\">👏 Clapping Hands</a>, which reflects speech-gesture pairings in Black English in the United States.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The 'writing hand' emoji on Apple devices is elegantly crafted with a sense of refined motion, appearing as if mid-stroke. Apple's distinctive glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients give the hand a realistic and almost tangible quality, with subtle highlights suggesting natural light. The fingers are poised to write, perhaps with a pen or pencil (though not explicitly shown), conveying the act of creation, composition, or the articulation of thoughts. This emoji, embodying Apple's focus on intuitive and expressive communication, is frequently used to signify writing, composing messages, journaling, or the process of putting ideas into words."
