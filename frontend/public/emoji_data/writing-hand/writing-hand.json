Apple's distinctive glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients give the hand a realistic and almost tangible quality, with subtle highlights suggesting natural light. The fingers are poised to write, perhaps with a pen or pencil (though not explicitly shown), conveying the act of creation, composition, or the articulation of thoughts. This emoji, embodying Apple's focus on intuitive and expressive communication, is frequently used to signify writing, composing messages, journaling, or the process of putting ideas into words."
