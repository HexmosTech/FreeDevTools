  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman tipping hand emoji on Apple devices is rendered in a light skin tone with a graceful posture and a friendly, almost playful expression. Apple's design imbues it with a soft, glossy sheen and realistic lighting, making the gesture appear approachable and helpful. The smooth, rounded edges of her hand and the subtle gradient in her sleeve on Apple devices emphasize its use for offering assistance, asking a question, or conveying a charming sense of sass."
