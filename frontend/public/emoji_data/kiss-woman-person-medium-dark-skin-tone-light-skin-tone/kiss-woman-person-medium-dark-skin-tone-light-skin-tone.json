  "apple_vendor_description": "This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, depicts a tender kiss between two figures with distinct skin tones: a medium-dark skin tone for one person and a light skin tone for the other. Apple’s rendering brings a beautiful realism with smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges, highlighting a sense of connection and affection. The gentle tilt of their heads and the subtle red lips convey intimacy, romance, and loving relationships."
