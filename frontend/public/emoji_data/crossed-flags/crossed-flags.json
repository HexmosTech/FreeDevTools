Each flag is rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy texture and soft, rounded edges, allowing for clear recognition of their designs and colors. The subtle 3D shading gives them a tangible presence, symbolizing international relations, shared journeys, or the merging of cultures and events, often used to represent travel, global partnerships, or sporting events involving multiple nations."
