May also be used in various science-related contexts more generally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter&rsquo;s design features two <a href=\"/high-voltage/\">electric bolts</a> coming from its poles.

  "apple_vendor_description": "The magnet emoji on Apple devices presents a classic horseshoe shape with a subtle, polished metallic sheen, hinting at robust magnetic force through Apple's signature 3D rendering.  Its surfaces catch the light with soft gradients, suggesting a smooth, cool texture, and its rounded edges contribute to its friendly yet functional appearance.  This emoji is often employed to signify attraction, connection, or the drawing together of ideas and people in digital conversations."
