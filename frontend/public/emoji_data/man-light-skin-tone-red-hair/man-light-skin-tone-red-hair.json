  "apple_vendor_description": "The man with light skin tone and red hair emoji, as rendered on Apple devices, presents a vibrant and distinct individual with a striking mane of coppery-red hair.  Apple's signature 3D shading imbues his hair with a rich, almost lustrous quality, catching the light with soft highlights.  His expression, typically neutral or subtly pleased, is framed by smooth, rounded facial features that are characteristic of Apple's friendly and approachable emoji design. This emoji is a fantastic way to represent oneself or others with this specific hair color and skin tone, adding a personal touch to digital conversations."
