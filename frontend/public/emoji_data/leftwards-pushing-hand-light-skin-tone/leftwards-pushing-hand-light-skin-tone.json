  "apple_vendor_description": "The leftwards pushing hand emoji, depicted with a light skin tone on Apple devices, is a dynamic gesture with a clear sense of forward motion. Its smooth, rounded fingers and subtle 3D shading, characteristic of Appleâ€™s design, convey a gentle yet firm push or rejection. This emoji is frequently used on Apple devices to indicate turning away from something, disagreeing, or politely declining an offer."
