  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the sushi emoji presents a delectable nigiri, typically featuring a glistening slice of salmon atop a perfectly molded mound of rice. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting make the texture of the rice and the vibrant color of the fish pop with appetizing detail. This emoji, with its smooth, rounded edges, is a delightful way to convey a love for Japanese cuisine, a desire for a meal, or a celebratory treat."
