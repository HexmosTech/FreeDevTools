  "apple_vendor_description": "The leftwards pushing hand emoji on Apple devices is depicted with a distinct sense of forward momentum and polite deflection. Its smooth, rounded fingers and palm are rendered with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting, giving it a subtle 3D depth and a confident, yet gentle, push. This emoji effectively communicates 'no,' 'stop,' 'go away,' or a gentle redirection, all with the approachable and professional aesthetic of Apple's emoji design."
