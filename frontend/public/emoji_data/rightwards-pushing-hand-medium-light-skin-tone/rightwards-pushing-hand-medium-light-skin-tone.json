  "description": "Represents a hand pushing something away or indicating a stop, with a medium-light skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the medium-light skin tone rightwards pushing hand emoji is depicted with a smooth, inviting gradient, showcasing realistic lighting that gives it a palpable, three-dimensional form. The hand, with its softly rounded edges, is shown open and palm facing forward, subtly conveying a sense of stopping, pushing away, or setting a boundary. This versatile emoji on Apple devices is frequently used to indicate 'stop,' 'hold on,' or to firmly reject an idea, all while maintaining Apple's clean and intuitive visual language."
