The hand, with its softly rounded edges, is shown open and palm facing forward, subtly conveying a sense of stopping, pushing away, or setting a boundary. This versatile emoji on Apple devices is frequently used to indicate 'stop,' 'hold on,' or to firmly reject an idea, all while maintaining Apple's clean and intuitive visual language."
