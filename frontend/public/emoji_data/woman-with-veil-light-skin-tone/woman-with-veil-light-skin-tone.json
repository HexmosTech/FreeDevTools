  "description": "A woman wearing a veil, often associated with weddings or religious ceremonies, depicted with a light skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman with veil emoji, as seen on Apple devices, presents a graceful figure with a luminous, light skin tone, adorned by a delicate, translucent veil that drapes softly. Apple‚Äôs signature 3D shading and smooth gradients create a sense of ethereal beauty and refined elegance, with gentle highlights emphasizing the subtle contours of her face. This emoji, with its sophisticated and somewhat enigmatic portrayal on Apple devices, can symbolize important life events like weddings, celebrations of faith, or moments requiring solemnity and grace."
