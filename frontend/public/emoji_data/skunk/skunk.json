Depicted in full profile on all fours facing left, with black hair and its distinctive white stripe running from its head down to a curled-up tail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google&rsquo;s original skunk design bore a humorously&nbsp;haughty air.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The skunk emoji on Apple devices presents a charmingly rendered creature with a bold black body and a striking white stripe running down its back and bushy tail. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading gives its fur a soft, tactile appearance, while realistic lighting highlights its rounded features and curious expression. This emoji, with its distinct appearance, is often used humorously to signify something smelly, a surprising revelation, or a playful, albeit sometimes pungent, personality."
