  "apple_vendor_description": "The astronaut emoji on Apple devices, featuring a man with medium skin tone, is a striking portrayal of exploration and ambition, encased in a detailed spacesuit.  The helmet's visor reflects light with a realistic sheen, and the suit's textures are rendered with Apple's signature 3D shading, giving it a sense of depth and presence.  This emoji powerfully symbolizes adventure, the unknown, scientific curiosity, and reaching for the stars, inspiring a sense of wonder in your digital communications."
