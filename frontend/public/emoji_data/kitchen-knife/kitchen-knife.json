  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's kitchen knife emoji is presented with a sharp, metallic gleam, featuring a well-defined blade and handle rendered with realistic lighting. On Apple devices, the knife's polished surface and subtle 3D shading give it a professional and precise appearance, evoking culinary endeavors. Its clean design makes it a clear symbol for cooking, food preparation, or even a more pointed, though often playful, remark."
