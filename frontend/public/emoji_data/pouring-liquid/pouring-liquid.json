  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the pouring liquid emoji is depicted as a stream of translucent, light blue liquid cascading from a stylized spout, showcasing Apple's expertise in realistic lighting and glossy 3D effects. The fluid's subtle highlights and soft rounded edges suggest a smooth, continuous flow, creating a visually appealing and dynamic representation. This emoji is commonly used to signify drinks, spills, or the act of pouring something, adding a touch of action to messages."
