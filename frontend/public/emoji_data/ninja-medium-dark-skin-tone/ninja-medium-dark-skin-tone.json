  "apple_vendor_description": "The ninja emoji on Apple devices presents a swift and agile figure with a medium-dark skin tone, cloaked in traditional attire.  Apple‚Äôs design language emphasizes smooth gradients and sharp, defined edges for the costume, while the face remains partially obscured, adding an air of mystery.  This emoji, with its subtle 3D rendering and realistic lighting, evokes stealth, skill, and a touch of playful intrigue in digital communication on Apple devices."
