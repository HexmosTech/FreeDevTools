  "apple_vendor_description": "The Japanese prohibited button emoji, as seen on Apple devices, presents a bold, circular red sign with a thick white border. Inside, a stylized white horizontal bar is overlaid on a vertical bar, creating a stark, universally understood symbol of prohibition or a \"no\" instruction. This emoji's clean lines and precise 3D shading on Apple devices convey a clear and unambiguous message of restriction or what is not allowed."
