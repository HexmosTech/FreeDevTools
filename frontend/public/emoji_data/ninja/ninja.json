It combined&nbsp;<a href=\"/cat-face/\">🐱 Cat Face</a> and <a href=\"/bust-in-silhouette/\">👤 Bust in Silhouette</a> and was&nbsp;only available from Microsoft prior to the debut of the <em>Fluent </em>emoji set in November 2021.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The ninja emoji on Apple devices is rendered with a dark, silhouetted form, hinting at stealth and mystery. Its sharp, angular lines and subtle sheen suggest swift movement and a mastery of shadows, a signature of Apple's detailed 3D artistry. This emoji is often used to convey a sense of being discreet, quick, or capable of handling tasks with silent efficiency."
