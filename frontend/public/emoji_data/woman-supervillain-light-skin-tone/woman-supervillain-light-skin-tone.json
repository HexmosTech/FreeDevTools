She sports a dramatic, flowing cape in a deep, rich color, accented by sharp, angular details and realistic lighting that casts subtle shadows, emphasizing her formidable persona. Her expression is one of intense determination, hinting at mischief or grand schemes, making her a perfect symbol for powerful individuals or playful declarations of villainy in digital conversations."
