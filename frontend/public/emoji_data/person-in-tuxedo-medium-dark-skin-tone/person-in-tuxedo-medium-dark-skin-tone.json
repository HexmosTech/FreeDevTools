  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s rendition of the person in a tuxedo emoji presents a distinguished figure with a medium-dark skin tone, impeccably dressed for a formal occasion. The sharp lines of the tuxedo and bow tie are rendered with Apple's signature polished detail, featuring subtle highlights and shadows that emphasize its crispness and texture. This emoji, with its sophisticated appearance on Apple devices, is perfect for signifying elegance, celebrations, or a touch of formal flair in any message."
