  "description": "The Male Astronaut, Type-3 emoji is a sequence of the  Man,  Emoji Modifier Fitzpatrick Type-3 and  Rocket emojis. These are combined",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The man astronaut emoji, rendered with a medium-light skin tone on Apple devices, appears ready for an interstellar journey with a detailed, glossy spacesuit. Apple’s characteristic 3D shading gives the helmet a reflective visor and the suit a sense of volume, as if bathed in cosmic light. This emoji evokes a sense of wonder, exploration, and ambition, perfect for conveying dreams of discovery or a groundbreaking idea."
