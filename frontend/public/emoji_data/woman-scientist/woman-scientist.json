  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman scientist emoji is depicted with an air of thoughtful curiosity, adorned with a lab coat and often holding a beaker or test tube, all rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and detailed realism. Her focused expression and the subtle gleam on her scientific instruments, enhanced by realistic lighting, speak to innovation and discovery. The emoji’s soft rounded edges and polished finish make it a versatile symbol for STEM fields, research, or any pursuit of knowledge and understanding on Apple devices."
