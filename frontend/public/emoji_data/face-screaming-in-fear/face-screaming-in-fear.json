Its wide-open mouth, contorted eyes, and perhaps hands clasped to its face convey overwhelming shock and fright, a common visual shorthand for extreme fear or surprise. On Apple devices, this emoji is perfect for expressing intense emotions, reacting to something shocking, or adding a hyperbolic element to a message."
