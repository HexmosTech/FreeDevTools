  "apple_vendor_description": "The large purple square emoji on Apple devices boasts a rich, velvety violet hue, rendered with deep, glossy 3D shading that gives it a substantial and almost tangible presence. Smooth gradients enhance its dimensional quality, making it appear as a solid, polished block. This emoji is often used to add visual emphasis, represent abstract concepts, or simply to introduce a splash of bold color into digital communication on Apple devices."
