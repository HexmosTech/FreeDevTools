  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person with a crown emoji, here shown with a medium-dark skin tone, radiates an aura of authority and importance with its regal adornment. The crown itself gleams with a subtle metallic sheen, enhanced by Apple's signature realistic lighting and glossy 3D shading, suggesting nobility or a position of power. This emoji is often employed to denote leadership, a special achievement, royalty, or to playfully confer a sense of being the best or most important in a message on Apple devices."
