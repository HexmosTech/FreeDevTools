  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji depicts a woman’s face with a gentle, closed-mouth smile and slightly pursed lips, rendered in a rich, medium-dark skin tone. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading creates a subtle sheen, highlighting the soft, rounded contours of her cheeks and chin. The realistic lighting on Apple devices gives her an approachable and warm appearance, perfect for conveying affection, a lighthearted greeting, or a playful closing to a message."
