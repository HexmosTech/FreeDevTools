  "apple_vendor_description": "The dark-skinned person shrugging emoji on Apple devices is depicted with a classic gesture of uncertainty, arms outstretched and palms facing upwards.

This emoji is a universal symbol of 'I don't know,' 'who cares,' or a casual dismissal, offering a lighthearted way to convey a lack of knowledge or indifference in messages sent on Apple devices."
