  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this elf emoji with a light skin tone is depicted with vibrant, pointed ears and a playful, slightly mischievous expression. The rendering on Apple devices showcases soft, rounded edges and realistic lighting that gives the character a distinctively friendly and magical aura. Its bright green tunic and rosy cheeks, typical of Apple's detailed design, convey a sense of whimsy and folklore, often used to add a touch of enchantment or jest to digital conversations."
