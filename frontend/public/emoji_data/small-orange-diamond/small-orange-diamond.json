  "apple_vendor_description": "The small orange diamond emoji on Apple devices shimmers with a vibrant, sun-kissed hue, showcasing Apple's characteristic soft gradients and polished finish.  Its perfectly faceted form catches light from multiple angles, giving it a delightful 3D presence and a feeling of preciousness.  This gem-like icon, rendered with Apple's meticulous attention to detail, is often used to represent something valuable, a bright idea, or a small but significant positive element in digital conversations."
