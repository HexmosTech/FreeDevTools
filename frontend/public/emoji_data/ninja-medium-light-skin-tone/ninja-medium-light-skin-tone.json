  "description": "A ninja, a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan, depicted in black, often with a mask and weapons. This version has a medium-light skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the ninja emoji with a medium-light skin tone is a striking image of stealth and action, characterized by sharp lines and dynamic posing enhanced by Apple‚Äôs glossy 3D shading. The traditional ninja attire is rendered with smooth gradients and realistic lighting, giving it a sense of movement and mystery. This emoji is often used humorously to describe quick actions, secret missions, or a sense of quiet efficiency in digital conversations on Apple devices."
