Apple's realistic lighting and subtle 3D shading give it a solid, monumental feel, while the smooth surfaces suggest its importance and sanctity. The iconic golden crescent moon often adorns the top, rendered with a soft sheen that catches the light. This emoji is a powerful symbol of faith, pilgrimage, and the Islamic holy site, used by Muslims worldwide to express devotion and connection to their spiritual center."
