  "apple_vendor_description": "The ear emoji on Apple devices is rendered with exquisite detail, showcasing a soft, rounded form with subtle shading that mimics realistic human anatomy.  Its smooth gradients and gentle highlights give it a tactile appearance, suggesting the ability to hear and listen.  This emoji is often used to indicate that someone is paying attention, has heard something important, or to ask for clarification."
