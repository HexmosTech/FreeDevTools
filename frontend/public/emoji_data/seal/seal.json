  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the seal emoji presents a charming marine mammal with a sleek, dark gray coat and bright, curious eyes that convey a sense of gentle intelligence. The realistic lighting and subtle reflections on its wet-looking fur, characteristic of Apple’s design, make it appear almost tangible. This emoji is often used to represent marine life, conservation efforts, or simply a cute and friendly greeting."
