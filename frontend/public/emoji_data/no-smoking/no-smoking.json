  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the no-smoking emoji presents a stark, universally understood symbol with a clean, modern aesthetic. The familiar red circle and diagonal line are rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and subtle 3D shading, giving them a slightly raised, tactile feel.  A stylized, muted gray cigarette is depicted with soft rounded edges, emphasizing a clear and direct message against smoking, often used to convey disapproval or a health-conscious stance in digital communication on Apple devices."
