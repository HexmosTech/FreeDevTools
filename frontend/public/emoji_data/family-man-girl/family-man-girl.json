  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the family: man, girl emoji depicts a tender moment with a man and a young girl standing side-by-side, rendered with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and gentle 3D shading. The man is shown with a warm, protective stance, his features subtly defined by realistic lighting, while the girl looks up with a sense of youthful innocence, both conveying a feeling of familial love and connection. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is perfect for sharing moments of family togetherness and expressing the unique bond between a father and daughter."
