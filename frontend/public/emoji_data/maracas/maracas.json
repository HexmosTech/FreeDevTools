  "apple_vendor_description": "The maracas emoji on Apple devices are depicted as two vibrant, wooden instruments adorned with colorful beads and tassels, ready to shake out a rhythm. Apple's glossy 3D shading gives them a tactile quality, as if you can almost feel the smooth wood and the slight movement of the beads. Their lively appearance and association with music and festivity make them ideal for expressing joy, excitement, or a desire to dance and celebrate in digital communication."
