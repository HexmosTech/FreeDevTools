  "apple_vendor_description": "This superhero emoji on Apple devices features a dynamic figure with a confident stance, rendered in a medium skin tone with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. Its cape billows slightly, and the facial expression conveys determination and heroism, all brought to life with realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges. It embodies strength, courage, and the power to overcome challenges, often used to express support or a feeling of invincibility."
