  "apple_vendor_description": "The dove emoji on Apple devices is rendered with pristine white feathers, subtly shaded to convey a sense of gentle volume and soft, rounded edges. Realistic lighting catches its form, giving it a luminous, almost ethereal quality that speaks to peace and hope. This emblem of tranquility, as seen on Apple’s vibrant displays, is often used to convey messages of peace, goodwill, or a fresh start."
