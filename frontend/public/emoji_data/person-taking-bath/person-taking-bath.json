  "apple_vendor_description": "The person taking a bath emoji on Apple devices depicts a tranquil scene of relaxation, featuring a stylized individual submerged in a bubbly, foamy bath. Apple’s design language brings this emoji to life with soft, rounded edges and gentle, realistic lighting that highlights the shimmering water and frothy bubbles. The overall tone is one of peace and self-care, with the person appearing content and at ease. It's frequently used to communicate a need for rest, a moment of pampering, or the simple joy of unwinding on Apple devices."
