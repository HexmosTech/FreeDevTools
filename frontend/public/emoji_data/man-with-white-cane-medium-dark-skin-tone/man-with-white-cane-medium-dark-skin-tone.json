The white cane is depicted with clean lines and realistic shading, conveying its function and importance. Appleâ€™s design language imbues him with a gentle posture and a neutral, thoughtful expression, symbolizing independence, guidance, and accessibility. This emoji on Apple devices is a respectful way to represent individuals navigating the world with visual impairment or to highlight themes of support and understanding."
