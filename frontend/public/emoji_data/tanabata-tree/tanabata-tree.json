  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the Tanabata tree emoji is a charming depiction of a bamboo branch adorned with colorful streamers and elegant wishes written on small paper slips. Apple's design lends it a delicate, artisanal feel, with the bamboo stalks exhibiting subtle texture and the streamers flowing with a gentle, almost ethereal grace. The realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges of the paper slips suggest they are ready to catch the wind, symbolizing hopes, dreams, and the spirit of the Japanese Tanabata festival."
