  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the superhero emoji with a light skin tone is depicted in a powerful, heroic stance, clad in a vibrant costume and cape that billow with dynamic flair. Apple's masterful use of glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting accentuates the costume's texture and the character's strength, while soft, rounded edges keep the design friendly and accessible. This emoji is perfect for conveying a sense of empowerment, bravery, or the feeling of overcoming challenges."
