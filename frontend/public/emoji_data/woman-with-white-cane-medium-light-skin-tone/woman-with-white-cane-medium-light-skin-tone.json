  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman with a white cane emoji, rendered with Apple's signature medium-light skin tone, showcases a dignified and independent posture. On Apple devices, her form is sculpted with smooth, rounded edges and subtle gradients that give her a realistic, approachable presence, while the white cane is depicted with a clean, crisp sheen. This emoji beautifully conveys navigating challenges, personal journeys, or celebrating accessibility and resilience, all with the distinctive polished aesthetic of Apple‚Äôs emoji library."
