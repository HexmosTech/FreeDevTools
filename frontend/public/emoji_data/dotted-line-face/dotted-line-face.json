  "description": "<p>A muted yellow neutral face with a dotted or dashed outline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An established comic book trope, dotted lines around a character can represent someone that is invisible or hidden. It can also represent smallness, submissiveness, isolation, and depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This emoji has the same expression&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href=\"/neutral-face/\">😐 Neutral Face</a>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's dotted line face emoji presents a unique and enigmatic expression, with its features subtly defined by soft, diffused dots and Apple's characteristic smooth gradients. The overall tone is one of quiet contemplation or a sense of fading into the background, achieved through delicate shading and rounded forms. On Apple devices, this emoji evokes feelings of being overwhelmed, speechless, or a gentle disappearance from a conversation, offering a nuanced visual for subtle emotional states."
