  "apple_vendor_description": "The customs emoji on Apple devices is represented by a stylized document with a prominent, official-looking stamp, rendered with a polished, slightly raised texture and subtle glossy shading. The stamp itself features intricate details and a deep, authoritative color, suggesting official approval and regulation. This emoji, appearing with Apple's refined design, symbolizes adherence to rules, border control, official processing, and is frequently used when discussing travel, import/export, or bureaucratic procedures."
