  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the 'person shrugging' emoji with light skin tone conveys a sense of amiable uncertainty with its gently upward-turned palms and slightly raised shoulders. Apple's signature 3D rendering gives the figure a soft, rounded appearance with subtle highlights that suggest a friendly, approachable demeanor. This emoji, rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and realistic lighting, is perfect for expressing a lack of knowledge, indifference, or a casual 'I don't know' in digital conversations."
