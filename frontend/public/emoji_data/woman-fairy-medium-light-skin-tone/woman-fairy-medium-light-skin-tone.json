  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman fairy emoji on Apple devices is depicted with a radiant, medium-light skin tone, her form gracefully rendered with Apple‚Äôs signature smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges.  A delicate shimmer emanates from her translucent wings, catching the light with realistic reflections that speak to the intricate 3D shading Apple is known for.  She often conveys whimsy, magic, and a touch of enchantment in digital conversations."
