  "description": "<p>A lobster, a large crustacean with a prominent tail and pincers. Depicted as a reddish-orange lobster (as cooked) from above, with a long body and tail, short, tentacle-like eyes, and ten legs, the top of which are very large pincers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often used to represent lobster as food as well as in connection to the US state of Maine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its release year of 2018, Emojipedia&rsquo;s original sample image was criticized as anatomically incorrect but was shortly after <a href=\"http://blog.emojipedia.org/skateboard-dna-and-lobster-updated/\">resolved</a>. That year, the transgender community <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/trans-activists-lobster-emoji-flag-charlie-craggs-unicode-nail-it-a8474476.html\">embraced</a> the lobster as a symbol for their efforts for <a href=\"/transgender-flag/\">Transgender Flag</a>&nbsp;emoji.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung, WhatsApp, and Facebook&rsquo;s lobsters are depicted at an angle.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's lobster emoji is a striking and vividly colored representation of the crustacean, rendered with a rich, deep red hue and a glossy, almost wet-looking shell. The 3D shading and realistic lighting on its segmented body, antennae, and claws give it a tangible, lifelike quality, a signature of Apple's emoji design. Its posture suggests a lively presence, making it perfect for expressing anything from a seafood feast to a bold statement in digital conversations on Apple devices."
