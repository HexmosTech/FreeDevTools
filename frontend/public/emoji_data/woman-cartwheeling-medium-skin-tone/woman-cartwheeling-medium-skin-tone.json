The sense of motion is palpable, with her hair and limbs appearing to flow with energy and a touch of playful abandon. It's a vibrant emblem of gymnastics, acrobatics, celebration, extreme joy, or simply expressing an exuberant burst of excitement and playful spirit in messages exchanged on Apple devices."
