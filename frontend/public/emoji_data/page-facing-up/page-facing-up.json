  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the page facing up emoji unfolds with crisp white paper, showcasing subtle shadow and light to give it a realistic, three-dimensional presence. The soft, rounded edges of the paper and the gentle curvature of the page imply it's fresh off the press or ready for review. This emoji on Apple devices often signifies new documents, information being shared, or a fresh start in communication."
