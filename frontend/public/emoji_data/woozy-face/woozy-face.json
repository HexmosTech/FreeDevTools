  "apple_vendor_description": "The woozy face emoji on Apple devices presents a delightfully disoriented expression, with eyes askew and a slightly downturned mouth, all rendered with Apple's signature soft, rounded edges and glossy shading. Realistic lighting gives its features a gentle glow, evoking a feeling of being dazed, tipsy, or overwhelmed. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is perfect for communicating a state of mild confusion, lightheadedness, or humorous disorientation."
