  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman with white hair emoji on Apple devices features a sophisticated portrayal, with strands of white hair rendered with subtle shine and soft texture thanks to Apple's realistic lighting and smooth gradients. Her expression is serene and wise, and the overall design utilizes Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges to create a friendly and approachable character. This emoji on Apple devices often signifies age, experience, wisdom, or can be used to represent a matriarchal figure or elder."
