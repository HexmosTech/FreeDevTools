  "apple_vendor_description": "The face vomiting emoji on Apple devices presents a sickly green face with wide, distressed eyes and a furrowed brow, conveying a strong sense of nausea or disgust.  A vibrant stream of green liquid erupts from its mouth, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting that emphasizes its unpleasantness. This emoji is perfect for communicating feeling unwell or expressing extreme disapproval in a humorous, albeit gross, way on Apple devices."
