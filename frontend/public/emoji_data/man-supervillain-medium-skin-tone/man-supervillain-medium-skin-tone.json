  "description": "A man with a cape and mask, embodying a supervillain persona. This emoji often signifies evil, power, or a dramatic, over-the-top character.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man supervillain with medium skin tone is depicted with a dramatic flair, wearing a crimson cape that flows with a realistic sheen thanks to Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. His stern expression, accentuated by sharp, defined features and a hint of shadow, conveys a sense of imposing power and theatrical menace. The overall design on Apple devices emphasizes his villainous persona, often used humorously to represent a challenge or a playfully over-the-top situation."
