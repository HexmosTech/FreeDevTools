  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the flower playing cards emoji presents a stylized, elegant bouquet of flowers intertwined with a single playing card, exuding a sophisticated charm. The petals are richly colored and feature Apple's hallmark glossy 3D shading, giving them a plump, almost velvety texture, while the card's edges are softly rounded. This unique combination often signifies a game of chance, good luck, or a touch of playful romance, rendered with the visual richness Apple is known for."
