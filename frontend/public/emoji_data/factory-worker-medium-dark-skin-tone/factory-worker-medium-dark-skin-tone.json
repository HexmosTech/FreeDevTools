  "apple_vendor_description": "The factory worker emoji, rendered with a medium-dark skin tone on Apple devices, stands with a determined posture, donning a sturdy work uniform. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading imbues the jumpsuit and hard hat with a sense of robust realism, while soft rounded edges suggest approachability. This emoji is perfect for conveying a sense of hard work, industry, or participation in manual labor, reflecting the dedication of workers across various fields."
