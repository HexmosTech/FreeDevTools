  "description": "<p>A spiral-bound calendar. Generally depicted as a monthly calendar, with a red or blue header. Apple and Samsung&rsquo;s pages are curled up at the bottom right, as to flip for a new&nbsp;month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like <a href=\"/calendar/\">📅 Calendar</a> and <a href=\"/tear-off-calendar/\">📆 Tear-Off Calendar</a>, commonly used as an icon for specific upcoming events or memorial dates. Also used for various content concerning time, date, schedules, planning, and observances and&nbsp;occasions more generally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microsoft, Twitter and Facebook&rsquo;s design feature a generic month. WhatsApp&#39;s design shows in a green header February, when it was incorporated in 2009. Apple, Samsung, and JoyPixels&rsquo;s designs show the month of July, when <a href=\"https://worldemojiday.com/\">World Emoji Day</a> falls on the 17th, a date Google&#39;s design <a href=\"/google/android-8.0/spiral-calendar/\">used to</a> specifically display.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The spiral calendar emoji on Apple devices presents a visually engaging representation of time, featuring a rolled scroll or calendar with a prominent spiral binding and distinct paper texture, all rendered with Apple's signature 3D shading and realistic lighting. The pages appear slightly worn, hinting at the passage of days, and the overall design evokes a sense of organization and planning. This emoji is ideal for marking dates, appointments, or important events, symbolizing scheduling and the unfolding of time on Apple devices."
