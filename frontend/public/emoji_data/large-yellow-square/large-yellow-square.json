  "apple_vendor_description": "This large yellow square emoji, as rendered on Apple devices, is a vibrant, sunny block of color with a prominent glossy sheen. Its smooth, flat surface is illuminated by soft, realistic lighting, giving it a friendly and approachable feel, characteristic of Apple's design language. The perfectly uniform shape and bright hue make it ideal for marking important events, signifying happiness, or simply adding a bold splash of color to digital communications on Apple devices."
