  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the 'eleven o'clock' emoji displays a classic analog clock face, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting that gives it a tangible feel. The hands are precisely positioned at 11:00, with the hour hand subtly pointing just before the 12 and the minute hand directly at the 12, all set against a clean white background with crisp, readable numerals. This meticulously designed emoji, embodying Apple's commitment to clarity and aesthetic appeal, is commonly used to indicate a specific time for meetings, events, or appointments."
