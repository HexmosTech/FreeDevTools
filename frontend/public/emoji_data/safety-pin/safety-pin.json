  "apple_vendor_description": "The safety pin emoji on Apple devices presents a polished metallic sheen, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. Its smooth, rounded edges and subtle highlights give it a tactile, almost tangible quality. This emoji, appearing as a classic silver safety pin, conveys a sense of security, mending, or a quick fix in digital communication."
