  "description": "<p>Brightly colored rope forming a knot. Knot type varies across platform, with most designs showing a square knot, a figure eight knot, or a carrick bend. Samsung&#39;s design appears to be a carrick bend, but upon closer inspection, it is not correctly tied and would fall apart with a gentle tug.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Used to talk about rope or knots in general. Sometimes used in the context of marriage alongside the idiom <em>tying the knot</em>.&nbsp;Also used in the kink community to talk about bondage. May be used as a stand-in for the word &#39;not&#39;&nbsp;in emoji rebus puzzles.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This knot emoji on Apple devices is a visually tactile representation of interconnectedness and complexity, rendered with a smooth, almost fibrous texture and subtle 3D shading. Apple's design emphasizes the tight intertwining of the strands, giving it a sense of strength and immutability. The realistic lighting creates a sense of depth, making it perfect for symbolizing solutions, challenges, or things that are tightly bound together."
