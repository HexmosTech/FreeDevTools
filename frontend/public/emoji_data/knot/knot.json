  "apple_vendor_description": "This knot emoji on Apple devices is a visually tactile representation of interconnectedness and complexity, rendered with a smooth, almost fibrous texture and subtle 3D shading. Apple's design emphasizes the tight intertwining of the strands, giving it a sense of strength and immutability. The realistic lighting creates a sense of depth, making it perfect for symbolizing solutions, challenges, or things that are tightly bound together."
