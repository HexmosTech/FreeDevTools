  "apple_vendor_description": "The kiss between two women emoji, as seen on Apple devices, radiates warmth and intimacy with its carefully crafted 3D design. One figure, rendered with a medium-light skin tone, leans in towards the other, who sports a medium-dark skin tone, their faces positioned for a tender kiss, highlighted by soft, realistic lighting that enhances the glossy sheen of their features. Apple’s signature smooth gradients and softly rounded edges contribute to an overall feeling of gentle affection and romantic expression, perfect for conveying love and connection between two women."
