  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Saudi Arabia on Apple devices is a vibrant representation, featuring a rich green background with the Shahada inscribed in stylized white Arabic script. Apple's design imbues the flag with a subtle 3D effect, making the script appear slightly raised and the fabric hang with a soft, realistic drape. The crisp white of the script stands out prominently against the deep, verdant green, symbolizing the nation's faith and heritage with clarity and dignity.",
