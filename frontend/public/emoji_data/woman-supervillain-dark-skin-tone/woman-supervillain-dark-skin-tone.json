  "description": "A woman with a Dark Skin tone dressed as a supervillain, often depicted with a cape and a menacing expression. It can represent evil characters, powerful female figures, or someone acting in a villainous way.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman supervillain emoji on Apple devices embodies formidable power with a striking, dark skin tone and an intense, focused expression. Her costume, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, features deep, rich colors and sharp accents that convey a sense of sophisticated menace. The soft rounded edges of her silhouette maintain Apple's approachable design language, while her confident posture and piercing gaze clearly communicate a daring, perhaps even dangerous, persona, often used humorously to signify a mischievous or powerful intention."
