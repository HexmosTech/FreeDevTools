  "apple_vendor_description": "The man mage emoji on Apple devices embodies mystical power with a dark skin tone, adorned in a flowing, deep-hued robe that displays rich, velvety textures through Apple's signature glossy 3D shading.  Realistic lighting catches the edges of his pointed hat and the subtle glow emanating from his unseen magical source, creating a sense of mystery and enchantment.  His posture is often poised and contemplative, reflecting wisdom and arcane knowledge, making him perfect for discussions about fantasy, magic, or powerful undertakings."
