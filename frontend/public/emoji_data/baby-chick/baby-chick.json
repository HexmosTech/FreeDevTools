  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the baby chick emoji is an utterly charming and fluffy rendition of a newborn bird, radiating an irresistible cuteness. Its soft yellow down is depicted with incredibly fine detail, catching the light to give it a vibrant, almost glowing appearance, a testament to Apple's realistic lighting and smooth gradients. The tiny, inquisitive eyes and delicate beak, all rendered with Apple's signature soft, rounded edges, make this emoji a symbol of new beginnings, innocence, and pure joy."
