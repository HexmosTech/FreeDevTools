The character wears a thoughtful expression, often depicted with a lab coat and perhaps a beaker or other scientific apparatus, all rendered with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and polished, rounded edges. Realistic lighting highlights the detailed textures, conveying a sense of precision, discovery, and scientific endeavor."
