  "apple_vendor_description": "The couple with a heart emoji, featuring a woman with light skin tone on Apple devices, radiates warmth and tender connection.  The two figures are gently intertwined, with the woman's form subtly leaning towards her partner, all rendered with Apple's signature soft gradients and glossy highlights that give them a lifelike, almost sculptural quality.  The heart above them glows with a vibrant, rosy hue, symbolizing love, romance, and deep affection, a perfect expression of a cherished relationship."
