Its design features Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and soft, rounded forms, giving it a friendly and approachable look. This emoji, rendered with a cheerful green hue and subtle highlights on Apple devices, can represent nature, perseverance, or even a playful, slightly mischievous sentiment."
