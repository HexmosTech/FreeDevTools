Appleâ€™s design language imbues this figure with soft, rounded edges and a subtle, naturalistic sheen, suggesting a sense of calm and mindfulness.  The serene expression and balanced form, highlighted by gentle gradients, make this emoji an ideal representation of meditation, yoga, or a state of deep relaxation in digital communication."
