  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the pleading face emoji presents a round, rosy-cheeked visage with large, glistening eyes that are slightly downturned, conveying an earnest and heartfelt plea. The subtle shading and soft edges, hallmarks of Apple's design, enhance its expressive power, making the sentiment of begging or hoping feel genuine. This emoji is frequently used to evoke sympathy, ask for a favor, or express a strong desire in a charming and disarming way through messages on Apple devices."
