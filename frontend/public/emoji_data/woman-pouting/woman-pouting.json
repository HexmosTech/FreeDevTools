  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman pouting emoji on Apple devices showcases a young woman with downcast eyes and distinctly downturned lips, conveying a clear expression of mild displeasure or sulkiness. Her features are rendered with Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and subtle shading, giving her a relatable and animated appearance. On Apple devices, this emoji is perfect for communicating a sense of being slightly annoyed, disappointed, or playfully upset in digital conversations."
