  "apple_vendor_description": "The vampire emoji with medium skin tone on Apple devices possesses an alluring and slightly mischievous charm, featuring sharp, pointed fangs peeking from a subtle smile and striking red eyes. Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting give the vampire a sophisticated, almost regal appearance, complete with a flowing cloak that suggests mystery and nocturnal power. This emoji often signifies a love for the spooky, the night, or a playful embrace of the dark side in digital communication on Apple devices."
