  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the bubbles emoji appears as a cascade of translucent, iridescent spheres, each rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting that creates captivating highlights and soft reflections.  Their smooth, rounded forms and gentle arrangement suggest a feeling of lightness, effervescence, and cleanliness, often used to convey a sense of freshness, joy, or a playful, bubbly mood in messages."
