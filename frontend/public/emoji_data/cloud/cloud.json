  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's cloud emoji drifts across digital skies with a soft, billowy form, rendered in a gentle gradient of cool whites and subtle grays. Its design on Apple devices features rounded edges and a subtle, almost luminous glow, suggesting a fluffy texture and the gentle diffusion of light. This emoji commonly represents weather forecasts, misty conditions, or anything ethereal and light, embodying Apple's commitment to clean, naturalistic visuals."
