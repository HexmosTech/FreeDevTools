  "description": "This version of the  Backhand Index Pointing Up emoji has the  Light Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Pale Skin Tone on suppor",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The backhand index pointing up emoji on Apple devices, presented with a light skin tone, features a clean, crisp rendering with a subtle glossy sheen. Apple's design language imbues this hand with a sense of directness and clarity, its fingers and thumb clearly defined with soft, rounded edges. The realistic lighting emphasizes the slight upward curve of the index finger, making it a precise and unmistakable indicator, perfect for drawing attention to something important or suggesting a direction."
