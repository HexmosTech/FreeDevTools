Apple's design language imbues this hand with a sense of directness and clarity, its fingers and thumb clearly defined with soft, rounded edges. The realistic lighting emphasizes the slight upward curve of the index finger, making it a precise and unmistakable indicator, perfect for drawing attention to something important or suggesting a direction."
