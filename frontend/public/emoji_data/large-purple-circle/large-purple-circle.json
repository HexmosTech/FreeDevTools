  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the large purple circle emoji presents a bold, vibrant shade of amethyst, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients.  Its perfectly circular form and subtle highlights suggest a smooth, polished surface, conveying a sense of depth and sophistication. This emoji on Apple devices is often used to add a splash of color to text, emphasize a point, or represent abstract concepts in a visually striking manner."
