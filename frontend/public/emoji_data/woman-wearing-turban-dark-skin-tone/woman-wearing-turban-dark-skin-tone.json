  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman wearing a turban emoji with a dark skin tone is depicted with a rich, deep complexion and a beautifully textured turban. The fabric of the turban displays subtle folds and creases, enhanced by Apple’s characteristic glossy 3D shading and soft, diffused lighting that gives it a tactile appearance. This culturally significant emoji on Apple devices can represent identity, heritage, and individual style, often used to convey a sense of pride or to represent a person or character in a narrative."
