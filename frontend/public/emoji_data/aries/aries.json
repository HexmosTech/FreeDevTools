  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the Aries emoji is depicted as a bold, stylized ram with curved horns, rendered in a warm, earthy brown tone with a polished, 3D appearance. Apple's signature realistic lighting accentuates the texture of its fleece and the smooth, rounded edges of its form, giving it a dynamic and spirited feel. This symbol of courage and determination, presented with Apple's characteristic depth, is often used to represent the zodiac sign, a strong will, or a pioneering spirit."
