  "description": "<p>A golden-brown, crescent-shaped, vanilla-flavored fortune cookie. Usually depicted with a strip of paper&mdash;on which a wise saying, lucky numbers, or&nbsp;<a href=\"/flag-china/\">Chinese&nbsp;</a>vocabulary is written&mdash;peaking out of its hollow shell. Given at the end of meals at Chinese restaurants in the West.</p>",
