  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the black flag emoji is depicted as a stark, matte black banner with a subtle sheen that suggests a rich, velvety texture. Its edges are softly rounded, characteristic of Apple’s design language, giving it a strong visual presence without appearing harsh. This emoji on Apple devices can convey a sense of defiance, rebellion, or mourning, often used to express strong emotions or to signify a surrender to fate or circumstance."
