  "apple_vendor_description": "The face exhaling emoji on Apple devices presents a round, soft-edged face with closed eyes and a gentle, downward-curving mouth, from which a subtle, wispy cloud of breath emanates, rendered with Apple’s characteristic smooth gradients and subtle 3D shading. The overall visual tone is one of relief, weariness, or release, perfectly capturing the feeling of letting go of tension or stress. It's frequently used on Apple devices to communicate exhaustion, calm, or the end of a challenging situation."
