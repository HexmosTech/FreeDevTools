A vibrant, heart-shaped glow emanates from their joined forms, rendered with Apple‚Äôs signature glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients for a soft, inviting feel. The figures are subtly angled towards each other, their forms outlined with gentle, rounded edges that convey a sense of closeness and affection, making it ideal for expressing romantic love or deep platonic bonds in digital communication."
