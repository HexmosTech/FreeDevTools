  "apple_vendor_description": "The Gabonese flag emoji, as rendered on Apple devices, features its iconic horizontal tricolor bands of green, yellow, and blue, presented with a subtle sheen and depth characteristic of Apple's design. Each stripe possesses a smooth gradient, and the flag itself appears to flutter gently, imbued with realistic lighting and soft rounded edges that give it a premium feel. This emoji on Apple devices serves as a direct representation of Gabon, used in discussions about travel, culture, or national identity."
