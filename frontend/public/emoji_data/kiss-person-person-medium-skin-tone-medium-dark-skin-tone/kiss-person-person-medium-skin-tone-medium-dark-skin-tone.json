The medium skin tone and medium-dark skin tone are subtly blended, and the soft rounded edges of their forms convey a sense of gentle intimacy. The subtle shine and 3D depth on Apple devices enhance the romantic and affectionate sentiment, commonly used to express love, passion, or a loving goodbye in messages."
