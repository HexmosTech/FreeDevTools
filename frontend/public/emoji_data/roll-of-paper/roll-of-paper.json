  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's roll of paper emoji presents a tightly bound scroll with a slightly textured surface, illuminated by soft, realistic lighting that casts subtle shadows.  The edges of the paper are softly rounded, giving it a tactile, vintage appeal characteristic of Apple's 3D rendering.  This emoji commonly symbolizes documents, historical records, important announcements, or creative projects, suggesting something significant being unfurled or presented."
