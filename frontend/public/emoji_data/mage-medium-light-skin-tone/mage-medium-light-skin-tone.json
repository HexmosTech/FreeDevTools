  "apple_vendor_description": "The mage emoji on Apple devices showcases a figure with a medium-light skin tone, clad in a flowing, deep purple robe that drapes with realistic fabric folds and subtle gradients. A conical hat, characteristic of wizards, sits atop their head, casting a soft shadow that enhances the emoji's 3D depth. On Apple devices, this character is depicted with a sense of mystery and power, often used to represent magic, wisdom, or a touch of the fantastical in communication."
