  "apple_vendor_description": "The general kiss emoji on Apple devices is a delightful burst of affection, rendered with Apple's iconic glossy 3D shading and smooth, rounded edges. It features a pair of stylized lips, often depicted in a soft pink or red hue, puckered and ready to deliver a kiss. The realistic lighting and subtle highlights give it a polished, almost tangible quality, making it a universal symbol of love, endearment, or a playful goodbye in digital communication.",
