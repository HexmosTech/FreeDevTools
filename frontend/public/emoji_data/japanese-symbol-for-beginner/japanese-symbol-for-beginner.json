Apple's design gives this symbol a clean, crisp appearance with smooth gradients and a slight gloss, making it feel distinct and official. Its bright green color symbolizes growth and potential, making it ideal for expressing that one is new to something, is a novice, or is entering a learning phase in messages sent on Apple devices."
