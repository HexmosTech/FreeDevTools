  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the Japanese symbol for beginner emoji is a vivid green circle adorned with a bold, white kanji character, immediately conveying a sense of newness and learning. Apple's design gives this symbol a clean, crisp appearance with smooth gradients and a slight gloss, making it feel distinct and official. Its bright green color symbolizes growth and potential, making it ideal for expressing that one is new to something, is a novice, or is entering a learning phase in messages sent on Apple devices."
