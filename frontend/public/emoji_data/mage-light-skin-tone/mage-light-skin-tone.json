  "description": "A wizard or sorcerer with a light skin tone, often depicted casting spells or holding a staff. It represents magic, fantasy, and the mystical arts.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's mage with light skin tone emoji features a whimsical figure adorned in a flowing, pointed hat and robe, rendered with a delightful softness and Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. Realistic lighting catches the fabric, giving it a tactile quality, and the character's facial expression, often a serene or focused look, is emphasized by the smooth, rounded edges of the design. This enchanting emoji, with its subtle glow, evokes magic, fantasy, and the power of the arcane, commonly used to express wonder or a touch of the mystical."
