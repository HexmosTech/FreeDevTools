  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the briefs emoji presents a pair of simple, white underpants rendered with soft, rounded edges and a subtle 3D effect. Apple's signature realistic lighting creates gentle shadows, giving the fabric a soft, tactile appearance. This emoji typically conveys a sense of informality, personal comfort, or can be used humorously in a lighthearted context."
