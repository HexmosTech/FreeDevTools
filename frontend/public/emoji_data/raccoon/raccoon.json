Generally depicted as a friendly, cartoon-styled, gray raccoon face looking straight ahead, with black-and-white markings around its eyes and&nbsp;pointed ears and cheeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple and WhatsApp&rsquo;s designs feature a raccoon in full profile on all fours facing left with a striped, bushy tail.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The raccoon emoji on Apple devices is a charmingly rendered creature with a masked face and bushy, ringed tail, brought to life with Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading. Its eyes are depicted with bright, inquisitive highlights, and its fur texture is suggested through subtle gradients and realistic lighting, making it appear both playful and a little mischievous. The soft rounded edges of its form lend it an approachable and appealing look, often used to represent curiosity, stealth, or a love for the wild."
