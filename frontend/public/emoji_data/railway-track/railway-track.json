  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's railway track emoji depicts two parallel, dark metal rails stretching into the distance, rendered with a sense of depth and realism thanks to Apple's meticulous lighting and shading. The weathered texture of the tracks and the subtle curves suggest a journey and the passage of time. On Apple devices, this emoji symbolizes travel, connection, a path forward, or the anticipation of a long-awaited journey."
