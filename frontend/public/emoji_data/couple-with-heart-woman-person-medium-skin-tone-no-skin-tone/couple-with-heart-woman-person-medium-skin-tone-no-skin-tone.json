  "description": "Depicts a loving couple, with one person being a person with a medium skin tone and the other person having a default (no specific skin tone) representation, connected by a heart, symbolizing their bond.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this couple with heart emoji beautifully illustrates a romantic connection between two individuals, with one figure rendered as a woman and the other as a generic person, both in a medium skin tone. A vibrant, glossy red heart floats between them, rendered with Apple's signature 3D depth and soft highlights, symbolizing their shared affection and love. The smooth, rounded edges of the figures and the radiant glow of the heart make this a warm and tender representation of partnership and deep emotional bonding."
