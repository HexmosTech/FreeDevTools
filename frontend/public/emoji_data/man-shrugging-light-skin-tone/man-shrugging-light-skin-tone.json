  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man shrugging emoji, depicted with a light skin tone, features a characteristic expression of uncertainty or indifference.  His shoulders are raised with soft, rounded edges, and Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting give him a relatable, slightly bewildered appearance. This emoji effectively communicates a lack of knowledge, a passive response, or a sense of helplessness in digital conversations."
