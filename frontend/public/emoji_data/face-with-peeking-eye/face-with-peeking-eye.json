  "description": "<p>A yellow face with its hands over its eyes and raised eyebrows. One wide eye is peeking through the fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can be used to express the duality of wanting to look away from something because it&#39;s frightening, disgusting, or embarrassing, but not being able to.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the face with peeking eye emoji captures a moment of coy curiosity with a slightly mischievous grin. Its rounded yellow face is rendered with Apple's signature soft gradients and subtle shading, making the single eye, peering from behind a hand, feel particularly expressive and playful. This emoji is perfect for conveying a sense of playful observation, shy interest, or a hint of playful surprise in digital conversations on Apple devices."
