  "apple_vendor_description": "The kiss, man, man emoji on Apple devices portrays two men with a warm, medium-light skin tone leaning in for a tender embrace, their faces softly rounded with Apple's signature smooth gradients.  A subtle blush adorns their cheeks, and the realistic lighting highlights the gentle curve of their lips meeting, conveying affection and romance.  This emoji, rendered with Apple's characteristic care and detail, beautifully represents love, partnership, and romantic connection between men."
