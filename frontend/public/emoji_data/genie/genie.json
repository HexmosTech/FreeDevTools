Variations exist for a <a href=\"/woman-genie/\">female genie</a> or <a href=\"/man-genie/\">male genie</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several vendors&#39; design for this emoji is highly reminiscent of The Genie character from Disney&#39;s <em>Aladdin&nbsp;</em>films.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The genie emoji on Apple devices materializes as a swirling, translucent cloud of vibrant blue smoke, hinting at magical power and untold wishes.  Its form is softly rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, creating a sense of depth and ethereal movement, while subtle highlights suggest an inner light.  This emoji, with its enigmatic aura, is perfect for expressing fantasy, surprise, or the anticipation of something extraordinary happening soon."
