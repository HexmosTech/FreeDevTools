  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s black small square emoji is a perfectly formed, minimalist geometric shape, rendered with a deep, matte black finish that absorbs light, emphasizing its clean, sharp edges. On Apple devices, it maintains a subtle 3D presence with a hint of depth, ensuring it stands out clearly against any background. This versatile emoji is often employed for organizational purposes, to mark divisions in text, or to add a touch of understated visual structure to digital content."
