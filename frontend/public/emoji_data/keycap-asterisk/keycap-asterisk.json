  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the keycap asterisk emoji is rendered with a crisp, clean design, featuring a star shape with five distinct points. Its subtle glossy finish and soft, rounded edges, characteristic of Apple's emoji style, give it a modern and approachable feel. This emoji is frequently used to denote emphasis, a footnote, or sometimes as a playful element in digital conversations on Apple devices."
