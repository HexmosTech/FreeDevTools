  "apple_vendor_description": "The light skin tone kiss emoji on Apple devices features two soft, rounded faces leaning in for a gentle embrace, their lips slightly parted. Apple’s characteristic 3D shading and smooth gradients give the faces a warm, affectionate glow, with delicate blush tones and subtle highlights. It’s a sweet and intimate way to express romantic affection, deep fondness, or a heartfelt goodbye in digital conversations."
