  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man genie emoji is a captivating figure, emerging from a swirling, iridescent puff of smoke rendered with Apple's signature soft, rounded edges and ethereal lighting. His skin has a subtle blue tint, and his attire is depicted with glossy 3D shading, giving him a mystical and powerful presence. This magical character on Apple devices often signifies wishes, dreams, or a touch of the extraordinary."
