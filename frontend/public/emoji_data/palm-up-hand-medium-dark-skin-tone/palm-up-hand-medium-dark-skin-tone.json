  "description": "A hand with its palm facing upwards, often used to signal offering, asking for something, or giving a high-five. The medium-dark skin tone indicates a specific huperson complexion.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the medium-dark skin tone palm-up hand emoji extends with a gentle, open gesture, its surface rendered with Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading that captures realistic lighting. The soft rounded edges of the fingers and palm convey a welcoming and receptive attitude, perfect for offering something or asking a question. This emoji, as seen on Apple products, beautifully represents generosity, giving, or an invitation to receive, adding a warm, human touch to digital conversations."
