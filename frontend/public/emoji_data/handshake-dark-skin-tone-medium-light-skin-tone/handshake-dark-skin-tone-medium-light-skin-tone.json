  "description": "Represents agreement, partnership, or a greeting between two people with different skin tones, specifically dark skin tone and medium-light skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This powerful emoji, as seen on Apple devices, captures the essence of agreement and collaboration with a handshake between two individuals of contrasting skin tones. One hand, rendered with a deep, rich dark skin tone, meets another with a warm medium-light skin tone, their fingers interlocking with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting and subtle 3D depth. The smooth, rounded edges of the hands convey a sense of gentle yet firm connection, making it an ideal representation of trust and partnership in digital conversations on Apple devices."
