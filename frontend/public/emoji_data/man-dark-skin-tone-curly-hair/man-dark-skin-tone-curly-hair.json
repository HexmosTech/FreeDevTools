  "description": "A man with dark skin tone and curly hair, representing a specific demographic. Used to represent individuals or to add diversity to depictions.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the man with dark skin tone and curly hair is a vibrant and dynamic portrayal, featuring rich, deep skin tones and a beautifully textured mass of curls. The 3D shading on Apple devices gives his hair a voluminous, almost touchable quality, while subtle highlights catch the light, accentuating the natural coils. This emoji, with its friendly yet grounded expression and smooth, rounded contours, is a versatile representation of male identity, often used to add a personal and authentic touch to conversations."
