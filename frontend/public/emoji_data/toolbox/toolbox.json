  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's toolbox emoji is a meticulously detailed representation of a classic carry-all for tools, finished with a robust, metallic gray hue. The glossy surface and realistic lighting on Apple devices give it a tactile, three-dimensional quality, emphasizing its practicality and readiness for work. Its soft, rounded edges suggest durability and ease of use, symbolizing preparedness, DIY projects, or the act of fixing and building."
