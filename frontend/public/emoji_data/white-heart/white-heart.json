  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the white heart emoji embodies purity, elegance, and a gentle form of affection. Its pristine white surface boasts a soft, subtle gradient that gives it a luminous, almost ethereal glow, a hallmark of Apple's sophisticated 3D rendering. The perfectly symmetrical, rounded shape, highlighted with delicate light reflections, communicates a pure and sincere sentiment, often used to convey innocent love, peace, or a desire for something clean and unblemished."
