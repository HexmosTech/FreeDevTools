  "description": "A hand with a medium-light skin tone, pushing outwards to the left. This emoji can represent pushing something away, creating space, or a gentle rejection.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this hand emoji is rendered with a gentle, inviting gesture, its medium-light skin tone showcasing Apple's signature realistic lighting and smooth gradients. The soft, rounded edges of the fingers convey a sense of friendly direction, pushing or gesturing to the left with subtle 3D shading. It's commonly used on Apple devices to indicate a preference, a direction, or to playfully dismiss something."
