  "description": "A hand with all five fingers spread open, often used to indicate 'stop', 'talk to the hand', or a five-count. The medium skin tone specifies the complexion.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the hand-with-fingers-splayed emoji in a medium skin tone is rendered with a gentle, open gesture, its soft rounded edges conveying approachability. Realistic lighting accentuates the subtle contours of the palm and splayed fingers, giving it a tactile and inviting appearance. This emoji, designed with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, is commonly used to signal a pause, to signify 'stop', or to express enthusiasm and openness in digital conversations."
