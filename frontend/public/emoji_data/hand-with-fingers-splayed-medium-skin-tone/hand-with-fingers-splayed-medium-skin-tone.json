Realistic lighting accentuates the subtle contours of the palm and splayed fingers, giving it a tactile and inviting appearance. This emoji, designed with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, is commonly used to signal a pause, to signify 'stop', or to express enthusiasm and openness in digital conversations."
