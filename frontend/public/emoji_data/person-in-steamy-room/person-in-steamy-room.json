  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person in a steamy room emoji captures a moment of relaxation and rejuvenation, featuring a stylized figure partially obscured by translucent, wispy steam. Apple's design language uses soft gradients and diffused lighting to create the impression of a warm, humid atmosphere, with rounded edges contributing to the serene visual. This emoji, appearing on Apple devices, evokes feelings of pampering, self-care, and unwinding, perfect for communicating a desire for peace or a spa-like experience."
