She is illustrated with a chef's hat and apron, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading that gives the fabric a tactile quality. Realistic lighting and smooth gradients highlight her confident posture and the tools of her trade, perhaps a whisk or a mixing bowl. On Apple devices, this emoji beautifully represents a love for cooking, baking, or a celebratory meal, embodying the joy of creating delicious food."
