  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman bald emoji features a gracefully rendered head with smooth skin, devoid of hair, celebrating individuality with Apple’s signature soft lighting and naturalistic tones. The gentle curve of her head and the subtle hint of a neckline convey a sense of quiet strength and self-assurance. This emoji offers a powerful and inclusive representation of women, often used to express resilience, personal transformation, or to identify with a community."
