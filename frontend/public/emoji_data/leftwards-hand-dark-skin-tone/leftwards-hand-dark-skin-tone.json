  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the leftwards hand emoji with a dark skin tone is rendered with meticulous detail, showcasing a smooth, rounded palm and fingers pointing to the left. Apple's signature realistic lighting and subtle 3D shading give the hand a tactile and dimensional quality, suggesting a clear direction or emphasis. This emoji, with its rich, dark skin tone representation, is commonly used on Apple devices to indicate movement, a turn, or to draw attention to something positioned to the left."
