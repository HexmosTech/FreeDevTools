  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman kneeling emoji portrays a moment of reflection or prayer with serene grace. Her light skin tone is depicted with soft, rounded edges and smooth gradients, conveying a sense of gentleness. The subtle interplay of light and shadow, characteristic of Apple's design, adds depth and a contemplative atmosphere, often used to express humility, gratitude, or a plea for peace."
