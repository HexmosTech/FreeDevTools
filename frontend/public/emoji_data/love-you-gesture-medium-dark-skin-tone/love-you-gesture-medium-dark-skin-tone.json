Apple's signature glossy 3D shading creates a subtle sheen, emphasizing the soft, rounded edges of the fingers and thumb forming the iconic 'I Love You' sign. The realistic lighting and smooth gradients enhance its warm, heartfelt expression, making it a perfect way on Apple devices to convey affection, gratitude, or a cheerful greeting."
