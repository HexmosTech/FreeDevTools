The fingers are artfully curved, creating a precise, delicate gesture that conveys a sense of 'just a little' or 'a small amount'. Its polished surface and soft, rounded edges make it feel both tangible and friendly, a versatile tool for indicating estimation or a subtle emphasis in digital conversations."
