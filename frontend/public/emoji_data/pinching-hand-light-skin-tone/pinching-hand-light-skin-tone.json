  "description": "A hand with the thumb and index finger pinched together, often used to indicate a small amount, a precise measurement, or a subtle gesture. The light skin tone specifies the skin color.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The pinching hand emoji on Apple devices, depicted with a light skin tone, is a masterclass in subtle animation and expressive detail, showcasing Apple's commitment to realistic lighting and smooth gradients. The fingers are artfully curved, creating a precise, delicate gesture that conveys a sense of 'just a little' or 'a small amount'. Its polished surface and soft, rounded edges make it feel both tangible and friendly, a versatile tool for indicating estimation or a subtle emphasis in digital conversations."
