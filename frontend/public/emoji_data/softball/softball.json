  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the softball emoji is presented as a perfectly spherical orb, showcasing Apple’s hallmark glossy 3D shading and vibrant, true-to-life coloring. The iconic red stitching stands out against the pristine white surface, each stitch rendered with a subtle highlight that gives it a tactile, almost touchable quality. This emoji, with its clean lines and soft rounded edges typical of Apple’s design, is a clear and direct representation of the sport, often used in contexts related to athletics, games, or a friendly competition."
