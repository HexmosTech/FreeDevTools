  "apple_vendor_description": "The couple with heart emoji on Apple devices depicts a woman and a person with no skin tone, united by a radiant, glowing red heart, rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy finish and soft, rounded edges. The figures are shown in a warm, connected embrace, their forms subtly shaded to convey affection and closeness, embodying a loving relationship. This emoji, as it appears on Apple devices, beautifully represents romantic love, partnership, and the joy of shared connection."
