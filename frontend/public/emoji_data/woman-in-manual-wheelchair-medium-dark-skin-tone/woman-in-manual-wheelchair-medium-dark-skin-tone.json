  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman in a manual wheelchair emoji, presented with a medium-dark skin tone on Apple devices, showcases a graceful posture and a meticulously designed wheelchair. Apple’s design language imbues the wheelchair with smooth, rounded edges and realistic metallic sheen on the spokes and frame, while the woman's figure is rendered with gentle curves and naturalistic lighting. This emoji on Apple devices is a powerful symbol of accessibility, independence, and diverse representation, often used to include or celebrate individuals with disabilities."
