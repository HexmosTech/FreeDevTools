  "description": "A person depicted as a man wearing a veil, with a dark skin tone. This emoji can represent cultural attire, religious practices, or specific identities where veiling is common. It's important to use with cultural sensitivity.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man with veil emoji presents a dignified figure with a rich, dark skin tone, distinguished by the elegant drape of a translucent veil. The veil's texture is subtly rendered, allowing for soft gradients and realistic lighting to create a sense of mystery and grace, a hallmark of Apple's detailed emoji artistry. This emoji, with its serene expression and rounded form, can symbolize cultural traditions, solemnity, or a sense of introspective thought, adding a layer of thoughtful depth to your messages."
