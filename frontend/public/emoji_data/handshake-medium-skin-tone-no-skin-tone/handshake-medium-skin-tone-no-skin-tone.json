  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's handshake emoji, rendered with medium skin tones and no explicit skin tone modifiers, showcases two hands meeting in a firm, professional grip, enhanced by Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting.  The smooth, rounded edges of the hands and the subtle reflections convey a sense of trust, agreement, and collaboration.  On Apple devices, this emoji is a versatile symbol for partnership, negotiation, and mutual respect, often used to seal a deal or express solidarity."
