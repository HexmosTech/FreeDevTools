  "apple_vendor_description": "The check box with check emoji on Apple devices features a pristine, slightly rounded square outlined in a crisp, dark gray, perfectly housing a bright, lively green check mark. Apple's signature realistic lighting creates a subtle dimensionality, making the check mark appear to rest within a tangible, three-dimensional space. This emoji is the ultimate symbol of a completed task, a successful selection, or a verified item, communicating a sense of order and accomplishment."
