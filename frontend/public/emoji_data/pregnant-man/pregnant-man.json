The emoji is crafted with Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, giving it a gentle and approachable aesthetic. Realistic lighting and subtle 3D shading enhance the depiction of the pregnancy, symbolizing inclusivity and evolving family structures, offering a modern and empathetic representation for communication on Apple devices."
