  "apple_vendor_description": "The ring buoy emoji on Apple devices presents a vibrant, circular flotation device, typically rendered in a bright, cheerful red or orange with crisp white accents. Apple’s design imbues it with a subtle, glossy sheen and soft, rounded edges, giving it a tangible, almost buoyant feel. This emoji commonly symbolizes safety, rescue, vacation, or a need for help, adding a visual cue for situations requiring support or a change of fortune in messages."
