  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman swimming emoji, rendered with Apple's rich medium-dark skin tone, captures the dynamic motion of being in water with fluid grace. On Apple devices, her form is depicted with smooth, rounded contours and subtle highlights that suggest the play of light on wet skin, enhanced by Apple's characteristic 3D shading. This emoji beautifully symbolizes recreation, fitness, or the refreshing feeling of a swim, embodying an active lifestyle with the polished and vibrant visual language of Apple."
