Her flowing hair, rendered with smooth gradients, adds to the magical aura, while the soft rounded edges of her form make her appear approachable and enchanting. This emoji on Apple devices evokes myth, fantasy, dreams, and a sense of wonder, often used to express a desire for escape or a playful, imaginative sentiment."
