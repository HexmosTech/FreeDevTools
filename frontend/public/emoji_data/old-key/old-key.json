  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the old key emoji is rendered with a charming, antique aesthetic, featuring a dark, burnished metal finish that hints at its age and history. Apple's characteristic 3D shading and realistic lighting accentuate the intricate details of the key's bit and the worn texture of its bow, giving it a substantial and authentic feel. This emoji symbolizes access, secrets, solutions, and the unlocking of opportunities, often appearing in contexts related to discovering something new or gaining entry."
