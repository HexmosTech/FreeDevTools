  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, Santa Claus is depicted with a jolly and benevolent expression, his iconic red suit rendered with plush texture and a glossy 3D sheen that captures the magic of the holiday season. The soft white trim of his hat and beard are highlighted with realistic lighting, giving them a fluffy, inviting appearance characteristic of Apple's detailed emoji design. This universally recognized figure on Apple devices symbolizes joy, generosity, and the spirit of giving, perfectly embodying the excitement of Christmas and winter festivities."
