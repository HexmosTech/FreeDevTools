The wheelchair itself is rendered with smooth, realistic lighting and subtle 3D shading, showcasing its sleek design and functionality.  On Apple devices, this emoji's soft rounded edges and dignified posture convey strength, resilience, and the freedom of movement, making it a powerful symbol of accessibility and personal empowerment."
