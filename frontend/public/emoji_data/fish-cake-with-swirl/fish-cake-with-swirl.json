  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the fish cake with swirl emoji is a delightful, circular treat with a prominent, spiraling pink design at its center, set against a creamy white background.  Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and soft, rounded form give this culinary icon a friendly and inviting appearance.  It's often used to represent Japanese cuisine, particularly ramen, or as a playful, visually appealing addition to food-related conversations on Apple devices."
