Its warm, earthy brown coat is enhanced by subtle highlights and shadows, giving it a pleasingly 3D appearance, while its gentle eyes and delicate antlers are depicted with soft rounded edges. This emoji evokes a sense of nature, tranquility, and quiet beauty, often used to symbolize the wilderness, a peaceful moment, or a connection to the natural world in digital communication."
