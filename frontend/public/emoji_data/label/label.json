  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the label emoji presents as a crisp, white rectangular tag with a small, neatly punched hole at the top, hinting at its attachment to items. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading creates subtle depth and a slight sheen, making it appear almost tangible. This emoji is frequently used to signify identification, pricing, or a specific item being pointed out in digital conversations."
