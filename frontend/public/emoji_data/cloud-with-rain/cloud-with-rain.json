  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the cloud with rain emoji depicts a fluffy, white cloud with a smooth, rounded form, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. Delicate, translucent raindrops are shown falling from the cloud's underside, catching the light with subtle highlights that suggest realism. This emoji on Apple devices beautifully conveys themes of weather, melancholy, or a feeling of being down, often used to express a gloomy mood or a rainy day."
