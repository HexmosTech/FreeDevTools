Delicate, translucent raindrops are shown falling from the cloud's underside, catching the light with subtle highlights that suggest realism. This emoji on Apple devices beautifully conveys themes of weather, melancholy, or a feeling of being down, often used to express a gloomy mood or a rainy day."
