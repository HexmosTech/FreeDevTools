  "description": "A yellow face with heavy bags under its eyes, often signifying exhaustion, tiredness, or a lack of sleep.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The face with bags under eyes emoji on Apple devices perfectly captures the feeling of exhaustion through its subtly detailed design. Apple's rendering gives the face a slightly weary expression, with prominent, shaded bags under the eyes that are emphasized by soft gradients and realistic lighting. The overall effect, with its characteristic glossy sheen and soft rounded edges, communicates a relatable sense of fatigue or lack of sleep with a touch of empathy."
