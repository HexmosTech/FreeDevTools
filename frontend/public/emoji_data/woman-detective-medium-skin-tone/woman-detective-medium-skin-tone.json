  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman detective with medium skin tone emoji embodies curiosity and sharp intellect, with a thoughtful expression and subtly highlighted features. She is depicted wearing a classic trench coat rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading, complete with realistic lighting that accentuates its fabric and form. The magnifying glass she holds is polished and detailed, its lens appearing to magnify the unseen, symbolizing investigation, problem-solving, and uncovering mysteries within the digital narratives on Apple devices."
