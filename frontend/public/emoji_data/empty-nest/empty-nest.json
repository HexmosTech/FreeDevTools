  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the empty nest emoji depicts a charming, woven bird's nest, subtly shaded to convey a sense of depth and natural texture. The soft, organic curves of the nest are highlighted with gentle gradients, suggesting a quiet, serene scene. It evokes feelings of transition, independence, or a peaceful absence, often used to represent children leaving home or a sense of quiet solitude, all rendered with Apple's characteristic visual polish."
