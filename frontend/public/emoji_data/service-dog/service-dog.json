  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the service dog emoji is rendered with a friendly, intelligent expression, often depicted as a golden retriever or similar breed with soft, rounded edges and realistic fur texture. Its posture is alert yet calm, conveying loyalty and helpfulness, while Apple's signature glossy shading adds a touch of warmth and approachability. This emoji on Apple devices is a symbol of assistance, companionship, and unwavering support, perfect for messages about pets, help, or emotional comfort."
