  "description": "A person working in a factory, often depicted in protective gear like a hard hat. Represents industrial work, personufacturing, and labor.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the factory worker emoji with medium skin tone is depicted wearing a crisp, blue jumpsuit and a matching cap, exuding a sense of industriousness and competence.  The signature Apple design language imbues the character with subtle 3D shading and realistic lighting, making the fabric appear soft and the helmet gently rounded. This emoji, rendered with Apple's characteristic attention to detail, is commonly used to represent labor, manufacturing, hard work, or a job in a production environment."
