  "description": "A person in a suit, appearing to levitate or float, with a medium skin tone. Often used to express a sense of surprise, elation, freedom, or a fantastical situation.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person in suit levitating emoji portrays a figure with a medium skin tone, dressed in a sharp, well-tailored business suit that appears to float effortlessly. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients give the suit a polished, dynamic look, with realistic lighting highlighting the crisp folds and textures. The expression on the face is often ambiguous, adding to the playful and surreal nature of the pose, making this emoji on Apple devices perfect for symbolizing a sense of freedom, an unexpected burst of energy, or a surreal, carefree moment."
