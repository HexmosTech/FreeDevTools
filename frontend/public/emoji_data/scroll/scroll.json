  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the scroll emoji is depicted as an ancient, rolled-up parchment, its edges slightly frayed and its surface textured to suggest aged paper.  The realistic lighting and subtle shading on Apple’s rendering give it a distinct depth, making it look like a tangible artifact ready to be unrolled.  This emoji beautifully symbolizes history, tradition, important documents, or the act of reading and learning, evoking a sense of timelessness and knowledge conveyed with Apple’s characteristic polish."
