The realistic lighting and subtle shading on Appleâ€™s rendering give it a distinct depth, making it look like a tangible artifact ready to be unrolled.  This emoji beautifully symbolizes history, tradition, important documents, or the act of reading and learning, evoking a sense of timelessness and knowledge conveyed with Appleâ€™s characteristic polish."
