  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman with veil emoji, rendered with a dark skin tone on Apple devices, offers a dignified and elegant representation. The veil is depicted with soft folds and subtle shading, creating a sense of gentle texture and depth, enhanced by Apple's signature realistic lighting. Her features are subtly rendered with smooth gradients, conveying a serene and composed expression. This emoji is used to represent women wearing veils, cultural or religious observance, or to add a touch of grace and mystery to digital communication, all with the refined touch of Apple's design."
