  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the upwards button emoji is a clean, minimalist representation of upward mobility and progression, featuring a crisp, bright white arrow within a softly rounded, light gray square. The subtle 3D shading and smooth gradients on Apple devices give it a polished and modern feel, suggesting a gentle push or an ascent. This emoji is commonly used to indicate moving up, increasing, advancing, or selecting an option to go higher in digital interfaces."
