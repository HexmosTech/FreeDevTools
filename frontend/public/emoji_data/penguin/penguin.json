Its plump body and bright orange feet, rendered with Apple's signature 3D shading and realistic lighting, make it instantly recognizable and endearing.  This delightful emoji, seen on Apple devices, is often used to represent cold climates, winter, animals, or to convey a sense of playful cuteness and whimsical charm."
