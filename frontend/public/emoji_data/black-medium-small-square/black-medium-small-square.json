  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the black medium-small square emoji presents as a perfectly rendered, solid obsidian shape with subtle, soft rounded edges that catch the light. Its deep, matte black finish, characteristic of Apple's refined aesthetic, conveys a sense of order, emphasis, or a placeholder for content. This precisely designed square on Apple devices is often used to create visual structure or mark a specific point within text."
