  "description": "A man wearing a veil, with a medium-dark skin tone. This emoji can represent cultural or religious attire, or be used metaphorically to suggest something being hidden or revealed.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man with a veil emoji presents a figure with a medium-dark skin tone, adorned with a gracefully draped veil, all rendered with Apple’s characteristic smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges. The realistic lighting subtly highlights the textures and folds of the veil, giving it a delicate and elegant appearance. This emoji conveys a sense of mystery, celebration, or a special occasion, often associated with cultural traditions or personal milestones, adding a unique visual narrative to Apple device communications."
