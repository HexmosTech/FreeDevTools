  "apple_vendor_description": "The middle finger emoji on Apple devices is rendered with a confident, slightly upward-pointing gesture, its skin tone depicted with Apple's signature realistic shading and soft, rounded edges. A subtle glossy highlight catches the light, adding a tactile feel to the digitally crafted digit. This emoji, as seen on Apple products, is often used to convey defiance, disapproval, or a bold, albeit sometimes impolite, statement."
