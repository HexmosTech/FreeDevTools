  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the 'two-thirty' clock emoji is rendered with a classic analog watch face, featuring a crisp white background and bold black numerals. The hands are precisely positioned at 2:30, casting a subtle shadow that enhances the 3D effect and realistic lighting Apple is known for. Its smooth, rounded edges and subtle gradient shading give it a polished, sophisticated look, perfect for indicating a specific time for a meeting or event in digital communication."
