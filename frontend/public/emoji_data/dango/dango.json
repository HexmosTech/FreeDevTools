  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's dango emoji is a delightful representation of the Japanese sweet, featuring three perfectly spherical mochi balls skewered on a brown stick, each adorned with a glossy glaze.  The realistic lighting and smooth gradients on Apple devices lend a tempting, almost edible quality, making it a sweet and playful way to express delight, appreciation for treats, or a cultural nod."
