  "apple_vendor_description": "The cactus emoji on Apple devices stands as a vibrant green, plump succulent with a few artfully placed, sharp spines that catch the light. Apple's design language gives it a subtly glossy, almost dewy appearance, highlighting its resilience and unique beauty. This emoji is often used to represent arid environments, resilience, or a prickly personality, all with a touch of Apple's characteristic charm."
