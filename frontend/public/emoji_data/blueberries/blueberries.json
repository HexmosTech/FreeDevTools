  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the blueberries emoji presents a cluster of three perfectly round, deep blue berries, each with a subtle highlight that suggests a plump, juicy texture and Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading. The soft, rounded edges and realistic lighting make them appear freshly picked and inviting. This emoji evokes feelings of health, sweetness, and natural goodness, often used in discussions about food, healthy eating, or simply to add a touch of vibrant color to messages on Apple devices."
