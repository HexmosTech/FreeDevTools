  "apple_vendor_description": "This sponge emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a vibrant, textured object with a characteristic porous surface rendered with meticulous detail. Its bright yellow hue, enhanced by Apple's realistic lighting and subtle highlights, gives it a cheerful and absorbent appearance. On Apple devices, it effectively symbolizes cleaning, absorption of knowledge, or even a state of being overwhelmed or soaking in information."
