  "apple_vendor_description": "The white exclamation mark emoji on Apple devices is a bold, clean symbol rendered with a smooth, slightly rounded form and a subtle shadow for emphasis. Its stark white color against a colored background (often red or blue depending on the context) makes it highly visible, conveying a sense of urgency, importance, or surprise. On Apple devices, this emoji delivers a clear and direct call for attention."
