  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the rock emoji presents as a substantial, weathered boulder with a variegated gray and brown texture, conveying a sense of solid permanence. Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and subtle shading give it a realistic, tactile appearance, as if plucked from a mountainside. This emoji on Apple devices often symbolizes strength, stability, or a difficult obstacle."
