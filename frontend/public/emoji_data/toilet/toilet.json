  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the toilet emoji is rendered with a clean, white ceramic finish, showcasing Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. Its soft rounded edges and subtle reflections suggest a modern and hygienic design, often used humorously or to indicate a need for a restroom. This emoji on Apple devices conveys a straightforward, utilitarian purpose with a touch of playful informality."
