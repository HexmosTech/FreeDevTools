  "apple_vendor_description": "The call me hand emoji on Apple devices, rendered in a light skin tone, features a perfectly sculpted hand with soft, rounded edges and a subtle, realistic sheen. Apple’s design language imbues it with a sense of friendly invitation, with the index finger and thumb forming a distinct 'call me' gesture that feels both modern and accessible. This emoji is a clear and direct way to signal a desire for a phone conversation or to prompt someone to reach out, all communicated through Apple's signature polished aesthetic."
