  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the front-facing baby chick emoji is an embodiment of pure, adorable innocence, with its plump, rounded body and bright, curious eyes rendered in Apple's signature smooth 3D style. The soft yellow fluff, enhanced by realistic lighting, gives it a tactile and huggable appearance, while the gentle curve of its beak and the subtle highlights on its form, all hallmarks of Apple's design, add to its endearing charm. This emoji is universally used to express cuteness, new beginnings, or a feeling of tenderness in messages sent on Apple devices."
