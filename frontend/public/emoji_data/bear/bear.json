Its fur is depicted with subtle shading and soft textures, giving it a cuddly and approachable appearance characteristic of Apple‚Äôs playful object designs. This emoji is commonly used to represent the animal itself, or metaphorically for strength, comfort, or even a hug, exuding a warm and reassuring presence on Apple devices."
