The light skin tone is subtly shaded, and the classic black tuxedo, complete with a bowtie, exhibits realistic lighting that highlights its texture and form. This emoji, with its smooth, rounded edges, exudes sophistication and celebration, often used to signify formal events, elegance, or a special occasion in digital conversations."
