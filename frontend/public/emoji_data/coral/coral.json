  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's coral emoji showcases a vibrant, warm orange-red hue, reminiscent of the natural wonder it represents. Its textured surface and organic, branching form are brought to life with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients, giving it a lifelike and almost touchable quality. This emoji evokes feelings of the ocean, tropical beauty, and the delicate ecosystems of the sea, often used in discussions about marine life, vacations, or vibrant aesthetics on Apple devices."
