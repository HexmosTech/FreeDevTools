  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the jellyfish emoji drifts gracefully, rendered with a translucent, ethereal quality that captures its otherworldly beauty. Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading and subtle internal highlights give the creature a lifelike, shimmering appearance, with delicate tentacles trailing elegantly. This emoji evokes feelings of wonder, the deep sea, and the serene, often mysterious, aspects of marine life."
