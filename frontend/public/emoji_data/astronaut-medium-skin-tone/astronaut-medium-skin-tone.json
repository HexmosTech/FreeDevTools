  "description": "Represents a person in an astronaut suit, signifying space exploration, adventure, dreams, and the pursuit of the unknown. This is the default representation if no specific skin tone is applied.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The astronaut emoji on Apple devices is a marvel of imaginative design, featuring a figure with a medium skin tone encased in a pristine white spacesuit. Apple‚Äôs signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting create a sense of depth, making the helmet visor appear reflective and the suit texture tangible. It evokes a sense of adventure, exploration, and reaching for the stars, perfectly embodying the spirit of discovery that Apple devices often inspire."
