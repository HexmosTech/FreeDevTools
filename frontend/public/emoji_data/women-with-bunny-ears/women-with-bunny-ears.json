Apple's signature smooth gradients and realistic lighting give these characters a lively, almost animated presence, with soft, rounded edges enhancing their friendly appearance. This emoji is frequently used to inject a sense of fun, playfulness, or a lighthearted, festive mood into messages, particularly around holidays or when signaling a whimsical sentiment."
