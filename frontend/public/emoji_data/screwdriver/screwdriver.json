  "description": "<p>A silver Phillips-head or slotted-head screwdriver with a colorful handle. Most platforms show a red handle, though Apple&#39;s design has a green handle. Used to represent construction, building, carpentry, renovation, or tools in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes used in phrases with &#39;screw&#39; in them like&nbsp;<em>screw you </em>or<em>&nbsp;have a screw loose</em>. Can also be used in sexual contexts due to the informal meaning of &#39;screw&#39;: &quot;to have sex.&quot;</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the screwdriver emoji presents a robust tool with a polished metal shaft and a distinctly ergonomic handle. The realistic lighting and subtle reflections on the metal hint at its practical utility, while the soft, rounded edges of the handle make it feel comfortable and well-designed, as is characteristic of Apple's approach to object rendering. This emoji is a straightforward representation of repair, construction, or mechanical tasks."
