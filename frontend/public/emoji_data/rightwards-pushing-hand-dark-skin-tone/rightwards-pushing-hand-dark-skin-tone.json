Its palm is slightly cupped, and the fingers are extended, conveying a clear sense of stopping or pushing away, all with the signature soft, rounded edges characteristic of Appleâ€™s emoji design. This emoji is often used in digital conversations on Apple devices to signal 'stop,' 'wait,' or to politely decline an invitation."
