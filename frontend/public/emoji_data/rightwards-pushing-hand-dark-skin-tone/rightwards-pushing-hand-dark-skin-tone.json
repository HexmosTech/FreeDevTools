  "description": "Represents a hand pushing something away or indicating a boundary, with a dark skin tone. It can signify resistance, refusal, or the act of pushing an object to the right.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the dark skin tone pushing hand emoji is rendered with a deep, rich tone that catches the light with subtle, realistic shading. Its palm is slightly cupped, and the fingers are extended, conveying a clear sense of stopping or pushing away, all with the signature soft, rounded edges characteristic of Apple‚Äôs emoji design. This emoji is often used in digital conversations on Apple devices to signal 'stop,' 'wait,' or to politely decline an invitation."
