  "apple_vendor_description": "The person facepalming (dark skin tone) emoji on Apple devices embodies a moment of exasperation or mild disbelief with a clear, expressive gesture.  Rendered with Apple's characteristic 3D shading and soft edges, the hand is positioned realistically against the forehead, conveying a universal feeling of 'oh no!' or 'I can't believe this.'  This emoji is a relatable and often humorous way to express frustration, embarrassment, or a moment of realization on Apple devices."
