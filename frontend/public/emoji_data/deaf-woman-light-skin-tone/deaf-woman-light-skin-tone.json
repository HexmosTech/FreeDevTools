  "description": "A woman with a light skin tone using sign language to indicate she is deaf or hard of hearing.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the deaf woman emoji with a light skin tone is depicted with a gentle and communicative expression, her hand gracefully positioned to form the sign for 'deaf' or 'hearing impaired'. Apple's signature realistic lighting and glossy 3D shading give her features a lifelike quality, while the soft rounded edges of her form convey approachability. This inclusive emoji on Apple devices beautifully represents communication and community."
