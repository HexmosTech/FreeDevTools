  "apple_vendor_description": "The dark skin tone woman receiving a haircut on Apple devices is depicted with a relaxed and pleased expression, her head tilted slightly as scissors trim her hair. The smooth, flowing lines of her hair and the gentle highlights on her skin, a hallmark of Apple's realistic lighting and 3D design, create a sense of personal care and transformation. This emoji beautifully captures moments of self-care, change, or a fresh start with Apple's characteristic attention to detail."
