  "apple_vendor_description": "The backhand index pointing left emoji on Apple devices presents a finely rendered hand with a light skin tone, depicted with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. Its index finger extends with a subtle upward curve, and the soft rounded edges of the knuckles and fingernail convey a gentle yet clear direction.  This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is perfect for subtly guiding attention to content on the left side of a screen or in a conversation."
