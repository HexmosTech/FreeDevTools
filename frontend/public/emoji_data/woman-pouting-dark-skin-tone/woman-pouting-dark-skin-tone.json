  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman pouting emoji features a striking dark skin tone and is rendered with Apple's signature expressive detail, capturing a moment of mild displeasure or disappointment. Her lips are gently pushed forward, and her brow is slightly furrowed, conveyed through subtle shading and realistic lighting that gives the face depth and emotion. The soft rounded edges of her features contribute to a nuanced, relatable expression, making this emoji a perfect tool for communicating a touch of playful sulkiness or gentle frustration in messages sent from Apple devices."
