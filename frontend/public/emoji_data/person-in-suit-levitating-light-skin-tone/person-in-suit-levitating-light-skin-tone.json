  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the Person in Suit Levitating emoji features a businessperson with a light skin tone, depicted in mid-air with a confident, almost jaunty stance. Apple‚Äôs design imbues the suit with crisp tailoring and a subtle sheen, while the figure‚Äôs levitation is emphasized by soft shadows and gentle 3D highlights. This emoji playfully represents success, ambition, feeling on top of the world, or a sudden breakthrough, often used to convey a sense of triumph or effortless achievement."
