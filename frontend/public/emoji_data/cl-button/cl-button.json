  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's 'CL' button emoji features a crisp, clean design with a distinctively rounded, almost pill-shaped form. The button itself boasts a subtle glossy sheen and a slight 3D bevel, giving it a tactile and modern feel characteristic of Apple's interface elements. On Apple devices, this emoji clearly signifies a 'Control' or 'Command' key, often used in technical discussions or when referring to keyboard shortcuts."
