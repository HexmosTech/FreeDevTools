  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's yo-yo emoji is a vibrant, playful object rendered with a polished, glossy finish that emphasizes its smooth, rounded form. The bright, contrasting colors of the two discs, often shown in a dynamic mid-spin, are brought to life by Apple's realistic lighting and subtle shadows, giving it a delightful sense of motion. This charming rendition on Apple devices perfectly captures the spirit of fun, nostalgia, and simple amusement in digital exchanges."
