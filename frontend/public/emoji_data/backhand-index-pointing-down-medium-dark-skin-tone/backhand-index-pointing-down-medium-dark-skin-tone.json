  "description": "This version of the  Backhand Index Pointing Down emoji has the  Medium-dark Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Dark Brown Skin",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The backhand index pointing down emoji, rendered with a medium-dark skin tone on Apple devices, features a distinctively smooth, rounded finger with subtle shading that suggests a gentle downward gesture. Apple’s signature realistic lighting creates a soft highlight on the knuckle and the tip of the index finger, emphasizing its direction. This emoji on Apple devices is commonly used to indicate a specific item, a location below the current message, or to emphasize a point being made in a conversation."
