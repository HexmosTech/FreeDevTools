  "apple_vendor_description": "The dark skin tone man tipping his hand emoji, as seen on Apple devices, presents a figure with a relaxed, open palm gesture, subtly angled as if to offer something or perhaps to convey a graceful dismissal. Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading gives the hand a polished, tactile appearance, with gentle highlights and soft edges that convey approachability and a touch of sophistication. This emoji on Apple devices is often used to express a polite 'you're welcome,' a subtle shrug, or an offer of assistance."
