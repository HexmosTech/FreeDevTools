  "apple_vendor_description": "This dynamic emoji, as seen on Apple devices, captures the dramatic intensity of a stormy sky with a fluffy, textured cloud casting heavy, translucent raindrops. A jagged bolt of lightning, rendered with Apple's characteristic bright highlights and sharp definition, streaks across the scene, conveying a sense of energetic power. On Apple devices, the glossy finish and realistic lighting lend a palpable sense of atmosphere, making it ideal for describing bad weather, a dramatic turn of events, or even a powerful emotional outburst."
