The medium-dark and medium-light skin tones are presented with natural warmth and realistic lighting, while the soft, rounded edges of their forms convey intimacy. This representation of affection, often used to signify romantic love or deep connection, feels particularly genuine due to Apple's meticulous attention to detail in its character designs."
