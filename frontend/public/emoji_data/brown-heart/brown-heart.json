  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s brown heart emoji is a warm, earthy tone, rendered with a subtle matte finish and soft, rounded edges that convey a grounded and sincere feeling. Unlike the vibrant hues of other hearts, this shade suggests a deeper, more steadfast affection, often associated with solidarity, support, or a sense of belonging. Its understated elegance on Apple devices makes it a powerful yet gentle way to express love or appreciation."
