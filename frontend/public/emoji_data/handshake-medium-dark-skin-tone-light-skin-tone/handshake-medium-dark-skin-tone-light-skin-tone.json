Apple's design emphasizes a realistic texture and depth, with glossy highlights that suggest sincerity and connection. The smooth, rounded edges of the hands and the subtle interplay of light and shadow on Apple devices make this emoji a powerful symbol of agreement, partnership, and mutual respect."
