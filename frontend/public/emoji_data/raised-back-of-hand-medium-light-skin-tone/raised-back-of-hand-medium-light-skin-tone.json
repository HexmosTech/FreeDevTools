  "description": "This version of the  Raised Back of Hand emoji has the  Medium-light Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Cream White Skin Tone on",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The raised back of hand emoji on Apple devices, shown here with a medium-light skin tone, features a hand held up with the palm facing away, fingers extended. Apple's signature smooth gradients and subtle highlights give this emoji a polished and distinct appearance, conveying a sense of stopping, pausing, or a gentle 'hold on.' The soft, rounded edges of the fingers and the clean lines of the hand make it a versatile symbol for requesting a moment, signaling a halt, or politely indicating a boundary in digital communication across Apple devices."
