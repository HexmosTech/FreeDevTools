  "apple_vendor_description": "The stuffed flatbread emoji on Apple devices is a warm and inviting depiction of a folded pastry, perhaps a gyro or a falafel wrap. Apple’s characteristic smooth gradients and realistic lighting give the bread a soft, toasted texture and hint at the delicious fillings within. Its gently rounded form and inviting appearance make it a delightful way to express hunger, share food-related plans, or simply convey a sense of comfort and satisfaction in messages."
