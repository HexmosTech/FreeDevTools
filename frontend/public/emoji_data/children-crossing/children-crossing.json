  "apple_vendor_description": "The children crossing emoji on Apple devices features two stylized figures, representing children, with soft, rounded edges and a gentle, inviting appearance. Apple's subtle 3D shading gives the figures a gentle depth, making them easily recognizable and universally understood as representing a school zone or a safe area for young pedestrians. This emoji serves as a clear visual cue for caution and awareness, rendered with Apple's characteristic clarity and friendly design."
