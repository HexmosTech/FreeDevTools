  "description": "A man wearing a veil, with a medium-light skin tone. This emoji can represent cultural or religious attire, or be used metaphorically to suggest something being hidden or revealed.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendering of the man with a veil showcases a thoughtful and dignified figure in a medium-light skin tone. The veil itself is depicted with delicate folds and a translucent quality, hinting at mystery or solemnity, all brought to life with Apple's characteristic 3D shading and soft lighting. This emoji, with its refined appearance on Apple devices, can symbolize cultural traditions, religious observance, or a sense of introspection and humility."
