  "description": "Represents a hand with the palm facing down, often used to signal 'stop', 'wait', or to push something away. The medium-dark skin tone indicates a darker complexion.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This expressive hand gesture on Apple devices, with a medium-dark skin tone, is presented palm-down and open, conveying a clear and direct message.  The hand features Apple's signature soft rounded edges and realistic lighting that subtly defines the contours and creases, giving it a tangible feel.  Whether used to indicate stopping, offering something, or a firm declaration, this emoji communicates a sense of groundedness, assertion, or a gentle push, all rendered with Apple's characteristic polished realism."
