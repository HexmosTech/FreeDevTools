  "apple_vendor_description": "This tender emoji on Apple devices captures a romantic kiss between two people, each rendered with a medium-light and medium skin tone respectively, their faces leaning in with a gentle embrace.  Apple's characteristic 3D shading and realistic lighting give the figures a warm, approachable feel, while the soft, rounded edges ensure a delicate and intimate presentation.  The subtle blush on their cheeks and the gentle proximity of their lips convey affection, romance, and a shared moment of passion."
