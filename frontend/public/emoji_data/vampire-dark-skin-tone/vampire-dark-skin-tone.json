Its sharp features and slightly elongated canine teeth are highlighted by realistic lighting, giving it a dramatic and slightly unsettling presence. This emoji is often used playfully to express a spooky mood, a love for the night, or a fascination with the supernatural, embodying a sense of dark allure."
