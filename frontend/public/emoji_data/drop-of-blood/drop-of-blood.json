  "apple_vendor_description": "Rendered with a striking crimson hue and a plump, rounded form, the drop of blood emoji on Apple devices has a liquid sheen thanks to Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading. Realistic lighting catches its surface, making it appear fresh and viscous, symbolizing injury, a cut, or a medical context. It can also be used metaphorically to represent sacrifice, intensity, or a strong emotional impact."
