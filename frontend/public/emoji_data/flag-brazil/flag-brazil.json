  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of Brazil on Apple devices is a vibrant display of its iconic green field, large yellow rhombus, and blue circle, all rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D effect.  Smooth gradients and precise lighting highlight the fabric's texture, giving it a dynamic, almost fluttering appearance as if viewed on a high-resolution screen. This emoji is a clear and proud symbol of Brazilian nationality, culture, and pride, perfect for expressing connection to the country."
