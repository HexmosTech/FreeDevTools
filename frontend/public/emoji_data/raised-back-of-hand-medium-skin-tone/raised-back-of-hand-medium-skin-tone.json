  "apple_vendor_description": "The raised back of hand emoji with a medium skin tone on Apple devices features a confident, open gesture with a clean, smooth surface. Apple’s characteristic soft rounded edges and realistic lighting give the hand a naturalistic feel, with subtle highlights that suggest a gentle shine. This emoji, with its upright posture and clear definition as seen on Apple devices, often signifies agreement, a high five, or a polite way to say 'stop' or 'wait'."
