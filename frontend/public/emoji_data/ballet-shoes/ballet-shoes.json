Sometimes used to represent dancing in general, rather than ballet specifically. Sometimes also used to represent the color pink.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the ballet shoes emoji showcases a pair of elegant satin pointe shoes, tied with delicate ribbons. Apple’s characteristic glossy 3D shading and subtle highlights give these shoes a refined, almost shimmering appearance. The soft, rounded forms and the graceful posture implied by the emoji suggest discipline, artistry, and the beauty of dance, making it a perfect symbol for aspiring dancers or anyone appreciating the performing arts."
