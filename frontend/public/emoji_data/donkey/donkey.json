  "description": "<p>A grey donkey or mule, shown in full profile, sometimes with its hind legs kicking into the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can be used literally to represent the pack animal. Can also be used metaphorically to call someone a <em>jackass</em>&nbsp;or to say that someone is <em>stubborn as a mule</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the donkey is a symbol of the Democratic Party of the United States, it may be used in political contexts. Additionally, the term <em>mule</em>&nbsp;can refer to someone who carries illegal drugs across borders, so this emoji may be used to talk about smugglers and the act of smuggling.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The donkey emoji on Apple devices is depicted with a gentle, slightly weary expression and soft, rounded ears that convey its characteristic calm demeanor. Rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, its fur texture appears soft and inviting, while realistic lighting gives it a friendly, approachable presence. This emoji often symbolizes stubbornness, patience, or a humble, down-to-earth nature in digital communication."
