  "description": "Depicts droplets of liquid, commonly representing sweat, water, or a splash. It can convey exertion, excitement, or a messy situation.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Rendered with Apple's signature 3D aesthetic, the splatter emoji appears as a dynamic burst of deep indigo ink, captured mid-splash with realistic lighting that highlights its fluid form. Its soft rounded edges and glossy finish give it a tactile quality, as if it's still wet and energetic. On Apple devices, this emoji is ideal for visually communicating messiness, creativity, artistic expression, or even a sense of chaos and sudden impact in your digital messages."
