  "apple_vendor_description": "The person in a suit levitating emoji with a medium-dark skin tone, as seen on Apple devices, is a whimsical representation of freedom and elation. Dressed in a sharp suit with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients, they appear to be joyfully floating upwards, their expression often one of playful surprise or carefree abandon. The soft, rounded edges and realistic lighting add a touch of polished charm to this emoji, making it ideal for conveying a sense of sudden success, exhilaration, or breaking free from constraints."
