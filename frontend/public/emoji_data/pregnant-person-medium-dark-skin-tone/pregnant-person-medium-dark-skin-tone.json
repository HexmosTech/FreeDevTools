Apple's design language imbues this emoji with soft, rounded forms and realistic lighting that highlight the subtle curve of the belly, symbolizing fertility, growth, and the journey of parenthood. Itâ€™s a respectful and tender representation used to share news of pregnancy or express support for expectant individuals."
