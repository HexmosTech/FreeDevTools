  "description": "<p>Clear safety goggles. When this emoji was approved in 2018 it was&nbsp;implied to be safety goggles rather than swimming goggles. A year later&nbsp;<a href=\"/diving-mask/\">🤿&nbsp;Diving Mask</a>, which is&nbsp;similar in design&nbsp;but used&nbsp;to represent swimming goggles rather than safety goggles,&nbsp;was approved.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The goggles emoji on Apple devices are depicted with a clean, modern aesthetic, featuring clear, slightly reflective lenses that catch the light with Apple's characteristic glossy finish. Their smooth, rounded frames suggest a comfortable and secure fit, hinting at adventure and preparedness. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, evokes a sense of protection, exploration, and readiness for exciting activities, whether it's diving into the ocean or tackling a new project."
