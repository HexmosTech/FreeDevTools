  "description": "A hand with the thumb and index finger pinched together, often used to indicate a small amount, a precise measurement, or a subtle gesture. The dark skin tone specifies the skin color.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the dark skin tone pinching hand emoji is rendered with a finely detailed, stylized gesture, appearing to grasp something with precision. The deep, rich tone is enhanced by Apple's realistic lighting and subtle glossy highlights, giving it a tactile and three-dimensional quality.  This emoji, with its soft rounded fingertips, is commonly used to convey a small amount, a delicate request, or a subtle hint, adding a nuanced touch to Apple communications."
