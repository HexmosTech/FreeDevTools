  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s eggplant emoji presents a plump, deep purple eggplant with a glossy finish and a prominent green stem, rendered with the characteristic tactile realism found on Apple devices. The smooth, rounded form and subtle highlights suggest ripeness and abundance, typical of Apple's detailed object designs. While often used literally to refer to the vegetable, on Apple devices it has also become a widely recognized symbol for playful innuendo and suggestive conversation."
