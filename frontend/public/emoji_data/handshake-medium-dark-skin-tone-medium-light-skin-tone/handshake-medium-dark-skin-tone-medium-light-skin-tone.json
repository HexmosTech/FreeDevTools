The emoji is characterized by Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, giving the hands a polished and tangible feel, further enhanced by realistic lighting that defines the contours. With its smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, this handshake symbolizes a strong agreement, a successful negotiation, or a friendly alliance, conveying a sense of mutual understanding and collaboration on Apple devices."
