  "apple_vendor_description": "The rightwards hand emoji with a medium-dark skin tone, as seen on Apple devices, is rendered with a smooth, inviting gesture and realistic skin tones. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and soft rounded edges give the hand a tactile quality, appearing poised to point, direct, or indicate movement forward. This emoji is a versatile tool for guidance, confirmation, or simply indicating a direction in digital conversations."
