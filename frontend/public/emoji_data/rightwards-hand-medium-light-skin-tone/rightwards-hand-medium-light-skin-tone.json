  "apple_vendor_description": "The rightwards-pointing hand emoji, in a medium-light skin tone, is a testament to Apple's refined design on its devices, appearing with a subtle dimensionality and polished surface. Realistic lighting casts soft shadows, giving the hand a natural, tactile quality as it gestures forward. Its clean lines and smooth curves make it an ideal visual cue for indicating direction, progress, or moving onward."
