The soft rounded edges ensure it fits seamlessly with other Apple icons, while the subtle highlights suggest a well-worn but reliable piece of equipment. This emoji symbolizes defense, security, service, and the armed forces, often used in contexts related to military matters or a strong sense of protection."
