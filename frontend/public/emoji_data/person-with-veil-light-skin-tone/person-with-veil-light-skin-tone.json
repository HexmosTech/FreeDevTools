  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person with a veil emoji, rendered with a light skin tone, is depicted with elegant simplicity and grace, the veil softly obscuring parts of their face while hinting at solemnity or mystery. Apple's signature soft gradients and realistic lighting create a gentle, almost ethereal quality, with the fabric of the veil appearing delicate and flowing. This emoji can represent various cultural or religious contexts, weddings, or a sense of gentle reserve and introspection, all conveyed with Apple's characteristic sensitivity."
