  "apple_vendor_description": "This affectionate emoji, as rendered on Apple devices, depicts two men sharing a tender moment, their faces angled towards a soft kiss. The characters, with distinct medium-dark and medium-light skin tones, are beautifully sculpted with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients, giving them a lifelike presence.  Realistic lighting casts subtle shadows, highlighting the gentle expressions and the smooth, rounded edges of their features, conveying a sense of love, romance, and intimate connection."
