  "apple_vendor_description": "The teapot emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a charmingly rendered ceramic vessel with a smooth, rounded form and a delightful gloss that catches the light. Apple's design language imbues it with a sense of cozy tradition, featuring a gently curved handle and spout, all brought to life with subtle, realistic lighting that suggests a polished surface. Its presence evokes feelings of warmth, comfort, and the simple pleasure of sharing a warm beverage, making it ideal for conveying relaxation or inviting a moment of quietude."
