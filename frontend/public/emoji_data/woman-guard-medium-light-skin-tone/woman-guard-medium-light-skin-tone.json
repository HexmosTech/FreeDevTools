  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman guard emoji, rendered in a medium-light skin tone, stands tall with a serious yet approachable expression, her uniform depicted with crisp lines and subtle shading. The realistic lighting and glossy 3D finish give her a professional and authoritative presence, characteristic of Apple's attention to detail. This emoji, with its strong posture and confident gaze as seen on Apple devices, symbolizes protection, vigilance, and a sense of duty, often used to convey security or to acknowledge those in protective roles."
