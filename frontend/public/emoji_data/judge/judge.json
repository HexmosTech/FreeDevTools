  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the judge emoji embodies authority and fairness with a distinguished, slightly stern expression. The rendered robe is a deep, rich black, subtly shaded with glossy 3D effects that catch the light, emphasizing its formal texture. This emoji, with its characteristic soft rounded edges, is often used to signify legal matters, justice, or making a final decision on Apple devices."
