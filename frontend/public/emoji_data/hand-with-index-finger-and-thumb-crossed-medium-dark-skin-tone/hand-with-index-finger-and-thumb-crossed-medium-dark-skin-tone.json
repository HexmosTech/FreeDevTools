  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the hand with index finger and thumb crossed emoji is rendered with a medium-dark skin tone, showcasing Apple's commitment to diverse representation with smooth, realistic shading. The fingers are gracefully curved, and the subtle glossiness applied by Apple's design team gives the digit a natural, tactile feel. This emoji, with its soft rounded edges and gentle highlights, is often used on Apple devices to convey good luck, hope, or a wish for something to happen, adding a touch of optimism to digital conversations."
