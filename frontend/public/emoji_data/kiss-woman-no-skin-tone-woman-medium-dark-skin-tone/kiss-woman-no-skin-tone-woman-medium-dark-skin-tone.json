  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji portrays a tender kiss shared between two women, one with a neutral, un-toned complexion and the other with a rich, medium-dark skin tone, their faces gently touching.  Apple’s signature 3D shading and soft gradients create a sense of intimacy and warmth, with the subtle gleam on their cheeks suggesting a moment of affection.  This emoji beautifully represents romantic love and relationships between women, conveying passion, tenderness, and a strong emotional bond."
