  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the cut of meat emoji presents a juicy, appetizing steak with visible marbling and a slightly seared exterior, all rendered with Apple's signature realistic lighting and glossy 3D shading. The soft, rounded edges and rich, varied tones of the meat give it a tactile and inviting appearance. This emoji is a delightful and direct way to express a craving for barbecue, a love for steak, or to discuss culinary plans when communicating on Apple devices."
