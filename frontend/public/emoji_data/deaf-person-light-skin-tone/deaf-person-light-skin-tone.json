  "description": "A person with a light skin tone cupping their hand to their ear, indicating they are hard of hearing or deaf. This emoji can be used to represent communication challenges, or to identify someone who is deaf or hard of hearing.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the deaf person emoji with a light skin tone is depicted with a clear, expressive gesture, using the sign for 'deaf' or 'hearing impaired' formed by fingers touching the ear and then the mouth, all rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and clean lines. The hand and fingers are softly rounded and illuminated with realistic lighting, giving them a tangible quality that emphasizes the clarity of the sign. This emoji on Apple devices serves as a vital symbol of communication accessibility, inclusivity, and the deaf community, fostering understanding and awareness."
