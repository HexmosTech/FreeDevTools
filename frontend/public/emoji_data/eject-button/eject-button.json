  "apple_vendor_description": "The eject button emoji on Apple devices presents a clean, minimalist design, featuring a prominent triangular arrow pointing upwards from a horizontal bar, all rendered with a crisp, metallic sheen. Apple’s precise lighting and subtle beveling give it a tactile, almost physical presence, suggesting action and removal. Its straightforward visual language on Apple devices makes it ideal for indicating the desire to eject media or to exit a process."
