  "description": "<p>A yellow face with its head tilted, its tongue hanging out of a big grin, and wide eyes in a wild, cockeyed expression. Generally used to express silliness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commonly represents acting goofy, having fun, and partying and is&nbsp;usually used&nbsp;in a positive manner. May be used in reference to someone or something that is off-kilter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/microsoft/windows-10-fall-creators-update/zany-face/\">Microsoft</a>, and <a href=\"/whatsapp/2.17/zany-face/\">WhatsApp</a>&nbsp;previously displayed&nbsp;a full-toothed grin instead of an open mouth with a protruding&nbsp;tongue, which appeared less silly and more menacing. <a href=\"/google/android-8.0/zany-face/\">Google&#39;s</a> design used to show the mouth in a grimace, which also read as more disturbing than silly.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The zany face emoji on Apple devices is a masterclass in playful expression, featuring a wide, slightly off-kilter grin and one eye squinted shut in a mischievous wink.  Rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, its vibrant yellow hue pops, and subtle highlights suggest a lively, almost bouncy texture.  This emoji on Apple devices perfectly captures a feeling of lighthearted silliness, unexpected humor, or a moment of delightful absurdity in digital conversations."
