Apple's signature 3D shading and realistic lighting give the fabric subtle folds and a realistic sheen, conveying modesty, cultural representation, or personal style. This emoji is often used to represent individuals from diverse backgrounds or to celebrate cultural heritage, embodying Apple's commitment to inclusivity in its digital communication tools."
