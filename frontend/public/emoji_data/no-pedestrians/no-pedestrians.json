The clean lines and flat, yet subtly dimensional, design typical of Apple's signage emojis clearly communicate a prohibition.  This emoji on Apple devices is a universally understood symbol for restricted pedestrian access, often used to convey warnings or indicate areas where walking is not permitted."
