  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person tipping hand emoji is rendered with a graceful posture, conveying a polite and helpful demeanor. The figure, depicted with smooth gradients and soft rounded edges characteristic of Apple's design, offers an open palm with a gentle upward tilt.  This subtle gesture, enhanced by Apple's signature realistic lighting, visually communicates helpfulness, a polite inquiry, or even a touch of playful sarcasm."
