These legs are rendered with a bold, metallic sheen and sharp definition, characteristic of Apple's precise 3D design and realistic lighting. The overall impression is one of robust heritage and unique identity, with soft, rounded edges contributing to its polished appearance and serving to represent the Isle of Man and its distinct culture."
