  "description": "The Woman Raising Hand, Type-5 emoji is a sequence of the  Happy Person Raising One Hand,  Emoji Modifier Fitzpatrick Type-5, ? Female S",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This Apple-designed emoji features a woman with a medium-dark skin tone, her arm elegantly raised with her hand open, palm facing forward. On Apple devices, the rendering boasts smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges, giving her skin a natural and tactile quality, enhanced by realistic lighting that suggests volume and form. Her expression, often a subtle smile or a look of helpfulness, combined with the open palm gesture, signifies a question, a request for attention, or an offer of assistance, all presented with Apple’s characteristic polished aesthetic."
