  "description": "Represents a hand with the palm facing down, often used to signal 'stop', 'wait', or to push something away. The medium-light skin tone indicates a complexion between light and medium.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the palm-down hand emoji with a medium-light skin tone is depicted with meticulous detail, showcasing the subtle curves and natural texture of a hand presented flat and facing downwards, rendered with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting. The soft, rounded edges of the fingertips and the gentle gradient of the skin tone contribute to its tactile appearance, conveying a sense of gentle restraint, stopping, or a calm dismissal. This emoji is commonly used to signal 'stop,' 'wait,' or to politely decline something, offering a clear and gentle visual cue within Apple's intuitive interface."
