  "apple_vendor_description": "The pea pod emoji on Apple devices showcases a plump, bright green pod, gently curved and bursting with character. Apple’s signature smooth gradients and realistic lighting create a delightful, tactile appearance, with subtle highlights suggesting the roundness of the peas nestled within.
