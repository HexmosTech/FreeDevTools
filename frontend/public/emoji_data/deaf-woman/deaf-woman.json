  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the deaf woman emoji is depicted with a medium skin tone, gracefully signing 'woman' with her hand near her ear. Her facial expression is serene and thoughtful, enhanced by Apple's smooth gradients and soft lighting that gives her features a gentle, approachable quality.  The detailed rendering of her hand and arm, with subtly rounded edges, emphasizes the beauty and clarity of sign language, representing inclusivity and communication."
