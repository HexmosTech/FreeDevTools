Apple's design imbues him with a sense of playful athleticism, highlighted by the glossy finish and realistic lighting that makes the ball appear to subtly rebound. Its soft rounded edges and smooth gradients give the impression of lively movement, perfect for expressing fun, sports, or active engagement in digital conversations."
