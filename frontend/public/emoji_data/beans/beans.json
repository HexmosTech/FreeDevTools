  "apple_vendor_description": "The beans emoji on Apple devices presents a small cluster of kidney-shaped legumes, rendered with a smooth, slightly bumpy texture and a rich, earthy brown hue. Apple's design imbues these beans with a subtle 3D quality, as if they are softly rounded and catching light, suggesting nourishment, healthy eating, or perhaps a simple, humble meal."
