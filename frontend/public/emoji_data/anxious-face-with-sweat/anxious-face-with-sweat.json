  "apple_vendor_description": "The anxious face with sweat emoji on Apple devices showcases a pale yellow face with wide, worried eyes and a furrowed brow, conveying immediate apprehension. A single, prominent sweat droplet glistens on its forehead, rendered with Apple’s signature realistic lighting and subtle 3D shading. Its mouth is downturned in a slight grimace, and the soft rounded edges of its design lend a touch of vulnerability to the expression of stress or nervousness."
