  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the angry face with horns emoji is a vibrant, fiery red, radiating a palpable sense of fury. Its devilish horns curve sharply upwards, and its furrowed brow and sharp, bared teeth convey intense frustration or mischievous anger, all rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. This emoji, as seen on your iPhone or Mac, is perfect for expressing a playful yet strong feeling of being thoroughly annoyed or a bit devilish in your digital conversations."
