  "description": "<p>A hedgehog. A&nbsp;small, spiny mammal sometimes kept as a pet. Generally depicted in full profile on all fours facing left, with a round, brown body covered with spines and&nbsp;a light-brown face and underside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes used to represent a porcupine or echidna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter&#39;s design has always been a hedgehog facing forward. Google&#39;s design originally featured a hedgehog facing forward, though it was changed to full profile with Android 11.0. Facebook&rsquo;s design <a href=\"/facebook/2.1/hedgehog/\">previously</a> featured a hedgehog&nbsp;on its back, rolled up in a ball.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The hedgehog emoji on Apple devices presents a charming, plump creature with meticulously rendered quills that exhibit a soft, earthy brown color and are highlighted with subtle glints of light, showcasing Apple’s commitment to realistic textures. Its tiny, dark eyes gleam with curiosity, and its small, rounded snout appears almost inquisitive, all brought to life with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and 3D shading. This adorable emoji on Apple devices is often used to convey a sense of shyness, natural beauty, or a playful, prickly personality in messages."
