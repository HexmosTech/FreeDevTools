  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's woman vampire emoji is a captivating figure, exuding an air of gothic elegance with a hint of playful mischief. Her stylized attire, rendered with Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading, features deep, rich colors and intricate details, while her pearlescent skin and subtly sharp canine teeth hint at her supernatural nature. The expression on her face, a common trait in Apple’s emoji designs, is a delightful blend of allure and a touch of the uncanny, making her ideal for expressing a dramatic flair or a touch of playful spookiness in messages."
