  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the woman with a beard emoji features a woman with a pleasant, neutral expression and soft, rounded facial features, accented by a finely detailed beard. The beard itself is depicted with subtle 3D shading, giving it a natural, textured appearance, while the overall design maintains Apple's signature glossy finish and realistic lighting. This emoji on Apple devices is a powerful symbol of identity, challenging traditional norms and celebrating gender fluidity and individuality in digital communication."
