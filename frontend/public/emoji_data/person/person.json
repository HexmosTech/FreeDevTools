  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the generic person emoji is rendered as a simplified, yet approachable human figure with smooth, rounded contours and a neutral expression. Apple’s signature glossy finish and subtle lighting give the figure a friendly, welcoming presence, making it a universal symbol for an individual, a user, or simply a placeholder for human representation in digital communication. Its clean design ensures clarity and broad applicability across various contexts."
