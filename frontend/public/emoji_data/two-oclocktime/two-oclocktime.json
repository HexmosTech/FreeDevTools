  "apple_vendor_description": "Represented on Apple devices, the two o'clock time emoji displays a classic analog clock face with crisp, white numerals against a clean, light gray background. The clock hands are rendered with precision, pointing directly to 2:00, and the overall design incorporates Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and soft, rounded edges for a polished look. This emoji is a straightforward way to indicate a specific time, often used for scheduling appointments or noting events happening around lunchtime or early afternoon."
