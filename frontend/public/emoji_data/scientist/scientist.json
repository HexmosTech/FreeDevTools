  "apple_vendor_description": "The scientist emoji on Apple devices is depicted with a look of focused curiosity, rendered in Apple's signature glossy 3D style with smooth gradients and realistic lighting. Typically shown with a lab coat and perhaps holding a beaker or test tube, the character's features are defined by soft, rounded edges, conveying professionalism and a dedication to discovery. This emoji beautifully represents fields of science, research, experimentation, and the pursuit of knowledge, often used to signify intellectual pursuits or a scientific endeavor."
