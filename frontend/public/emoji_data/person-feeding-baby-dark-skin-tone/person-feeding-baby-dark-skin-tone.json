  "apple_vendor_description": "This heartwarming emoji on Apple devices depicts a person with a rich, dark skin tone tenderly feeding a baby, their faces softened with the smooth gradients and realistic lighting characteristic of Apple's design language. The gesture of feeding is captured with a gentle curve of the arm and a subtle focus on the shared intimacy, evoking a strong sense of nurturing, care, and family bonds.  It's a beautiful representation of parenthood and the fundamental act of providing sustenance and love, often used to share moments of family life or express a deep feeling of responsibility and affection."
