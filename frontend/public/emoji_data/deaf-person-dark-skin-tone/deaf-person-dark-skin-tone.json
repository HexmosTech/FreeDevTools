The hand gesture, indicating 'hearing' or 'deaf,' is depicted with precise detail and soft, rounded edges characteristic of Apple's signature 3D design. This emoji on Apple devices conveys a powerful message of inclusion, communication, and understanding, celebrating diversity in digital conversations."
