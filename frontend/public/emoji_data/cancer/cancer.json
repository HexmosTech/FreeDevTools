  "apple_vendor_description": "As presented on Apple devices, the Cancer zodiac emoji is a beautifully rendered crab with a pearly, slightly iridescent shell, showcasing Apple's characteristic 3D shading and realistic lighting. Its claws are poised with a delicate strength, and the overall design has a soft, rounded aesthetic that feels both playful and elegant. This emoji, with its unique Apple interpretation, symbolizes the traits associated with the Cancer sign, such as nurturing, intuition, and emotional depth, often used in discussions about astrology or personal characteristics."
