  "apple_vendor_description": "The mosquito emoji on Apple devices is rendered with a surprising level of detail, its slender body and delicate wings catching the light with a subtle, almost iridescent sheen. Apple’s realistic lighting and sharp 3D shading give the insect a slightly menacing yet scientifically accurate appearance, while its tiny, almost imperceptible proboscis is clearly defined. This emoji, despite its small size, often signifies annoyance, a minor nuisance, or a bothersome situation."
