  "apple_vendor_description": "The chair emoji on Apple devices is a minimalist yet functional representation, often depicted as a simple, modern seat with clean lines and softly rounded corners. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading gives it a tangible, almost tactile quality, with subtle highlights that suggest a smooth, polished surface. This emoji commonly signifies comfort, rest, a place to sit, or is used in contexts related to furniture, home, or meetings."
