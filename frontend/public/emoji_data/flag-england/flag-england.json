  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the flag of England emoji, also known as St. George's Cross, features a bold red cross against a pristine white background, rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D effect. The vibrant crimson of the cross is deep and saturated, with subtle highlights that suggest a slightly raised texture, while the white field remains clean and bright. Its smooth gradients and soft, rounded edges give it a modern and friendly appearance, commonly used to signify English identity, support for English teams, or a connection to England."
