  "description": "<p>A swan, a waterbird with white feathers and a long neck. Depicted in full profile facing left, with a curving neck, orange bill, black eye marking, and wings and legs tucked in, as if gliding in water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May be used to represent a goose or, metaphorically, love, grace, and beauty.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the swan emoji gracefully glides with a pristine white plumage, rendered with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and smooth, subtle gradients. Its elegant neck curves with a gentle S-shape, catching realistic lighting that highlights its glossy 3D form, evoking a sense of serenity and beauty. This majestic bird is often used to symbolize grace, purity, or love, adding a touch of refined elegance to digital communication on Apple devices."
