  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the head-shaking-vertically emoji depicts a person’s head in profile, rendered with Apple’s characteristic smooth gradients and soft rounded edges.  The subtle shading suggests a gentle, slow movement from side to side, conveying a clear sentiment of disagreement or thoughtful refusal. This visual nuance, unique to Apple’s design, makes it an effective way to communicate a polite but firm 'no' in digital conversations."
