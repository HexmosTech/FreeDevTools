  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the flag of Kuwait is presented with its characteristic horizontal bands of green, white, and red, alongside a black trapezoid at the hoist. Apple's detailed rendering imbues the flag with a sense of depth and realism, using smooth gradients and realistic lighting to make the colors pop with a glossy finish. This emoji serves as a direct symbol of Kuwaiti national identity, commonly used in contexts related to the country, its culture, or its people."
