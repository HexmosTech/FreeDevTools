  "apple_vendor_description": "The peacock emoji on Apple devices is a magnificent bird, captured in all its iridescent glory with Apple's renowned attention to detail and glossy 3D rendering. Its elaborate tail feathers fan out, displaying a spectrum of vibrant blues and greens with shimmering highlights that suggest a luxurious, almost jewel-like quality. The gentle curves and realistic lighting on Apple devices imbue this emoji with a sense of beauty, pride, and exotic elegance, often used to represent vanity, showmanship, or admiration."
