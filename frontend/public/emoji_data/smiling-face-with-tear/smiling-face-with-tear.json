  "description": "<p>A yellow face with open eyes, a thin closed-mouth smile, and a single tear falling from one of its eyes. Can be used to express a wide range of emotions and expressions&nbsp;including gratitude, tender happiness, an attempt to look happy when actually sad, or&nbsp;smiling through pain. Can also be a response to something that is bittersweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This emoji and <a href=\"/slightly-smiling-face/\">🙂 Slightly Smiling Face</a> have a similar smile, and <a href=\"/crying-face/\">😢 Crying Face</a> and <a href=\"/crying-cat/\">😿 Crying Cat</a> have a similar lone tear.

  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the smiling face with tear emoji offers a nuanced expression of bittersweet joy or relief. On Apple devices, the eyes glisten with a single, perfectly rendered teardrop that catches the light, while the wide, gentle smile conveys a profound sense of happiness mixed with emotion. The smooth, rounded form and subtle 3D shading give this emoji on Apple devices a deeply human and relatable quality, often used to express overwhelming happiness, sentimental moments, or the release of tension."
