  "apple_vendor_description": "The pilot light emoji on Apple devices glows with a soft, warm orange flame, rendered with Apple's signature realistic lighting that suggests a gentle heat. Its 3D design features smooth gradients and a subtle sheen, conveying a sense of comfort, guidance, or a small, hopeful spark. This emoji often signifies the beginning of something, a quiet moment, or a gentle reminder of presence."
