  "apple_vendor_description": "The singer emoji on Apple devices, featuring a medium-dark skin tone, is captured mid-performance with a vibrant, dynamic energy.  Her lips are slightly parted as if belting out a tune, illuminated by subtle, realistic lighting that highlights the glossy texture of her attire and hair.  This emoji, with its inherent musicality and passionate expression, is perfect for conveying a love for music or a moment of vocal expression."
