  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's kiss: person, man, medium skin tone emoji presents a sweet and affectionate gesture with a gentle, stylized portrayal. The man’s face is rendered with Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and realistic lighting, featuring a warm, closed-mouth smile and a slight blush on his cheeks. The glossy 3D shading gives the emoji a tactile and inviting quality, making it an ideal way to express love, a kiss goodbye, or a tender sentiment within messages on Apple devices."
