  "description": "This version of the  Backhand Index Pointing Down emoji has the  Dark Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Black Skin Tone on supp",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the backhand index pointing down emoji appears with a rich, dark skin tone, rendered with Apple's signature 3D shading that gives it a realistic, tactile quality. The index finger is extended with a clean, defined tip, and the hand exhibits subtle curvature, suggesting a clear and deliberate gesture. This emoji on Apple devices is commonly used to direct attention downwards, indicate a specific item or location below the text, or to emphatically emphasize a point in a conversation."
