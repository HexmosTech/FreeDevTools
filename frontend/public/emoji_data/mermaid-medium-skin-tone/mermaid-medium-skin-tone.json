  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the mermaid emoji with a medium skin tone embodies enchantment with her gracefully flowing auburn hair cascading around her shoulders, catching realistic light from Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. Her shimmering teal tail, rendered with smooth gradients, curves alluringly, suggesting a mystical and alluring presence. This Apple-designed emoji evokes fantasy, wonder, and a connection to the sea, often used to express a sense of magic or escape in digital conversations."
