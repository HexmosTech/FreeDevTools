  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's pinching hand emoji features a delicate, yet assertive gesture, with the thumb and index finger brought close together. On Apple devices, this emoji boasts a smooth, realistic skin tone with subtle highlights that emphasize its rounded contours and glossy finish. The subtle angle and refined shading convey a sense of precision, emphasis, or a small amount, perfect for pointing out something specific or indicating a tiny quantity in digital conversations."
