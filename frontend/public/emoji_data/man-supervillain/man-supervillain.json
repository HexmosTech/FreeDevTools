  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man supervillain emoji embodies menace with a dramatic flair, sporting a black cape that flows with glossy 3D shading and soft rounded edges. His expression, often a stern or determined gaze, is rendered with subtle gradients that hint at hidden power and grand, world-domination schemes. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is perfect for conveying a sense of playful or mock evil, or when feeling particularly ambitious and ready to conquer any challenge."
