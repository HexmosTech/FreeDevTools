  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's pie emoji presents a delectable slice of pie, complete with a golden-brown, flaky crust and a vibrant, jewel-toned filling, perhaps cherry or berry, rendered with realistic shading and depth. The soft, rounded edges and subtle highlights on the crust make it look almost good enough to eat, a hallmark of Apple's detailed 3D design. This emoji is commonly used to express enjoyment, comfort, or to refer to delicious food."
