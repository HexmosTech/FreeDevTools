In 2016, <a href=\"http://blog.emojipedia.org/apple-and-the-gun-emoji/\">Apple switched its design</a> from weapon&nbsp;to toy; other major vendors followed suit by 2018.

  "apple_vendor_description": "The pistol emoji on Apple devices is rendered with a stark, metallic gray finish and realistic lighting that emphasizes its three-dimensional form and polished surface. Its design adheres to Apple's commitment to smooth, rounded edges, even for objects with a more serious connotation. This emoji on Apple devices is often used metaphorically to signify a strong opinion, a decisive action, or to add a dramatic flair to a message, though its literal representation should be used with consideration."
