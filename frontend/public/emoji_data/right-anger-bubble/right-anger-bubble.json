Its edges are crisp yet slightly softened, and the vibrant red hue, enhanced by subtle highlights, suggests an explosion of frustration or rage.  This emoji, with its dynamic visual impact on Apple devices, is a powerful way to communicate strong negative feelings or to punctuate a heated digital exchange."
