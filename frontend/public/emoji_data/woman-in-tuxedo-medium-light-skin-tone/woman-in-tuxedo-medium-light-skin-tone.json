  "description": "A woman wearing a tuxedo, signifying professionalism, formality, or a sophisticated occasion. The medium-light skin tone is indicated.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman in a tuxedo emoji, presented with a medium-light skin tone, exudes sophisticated confidence with her sharp, tailored black tuxedo. Apple's signature 3D design lends a polished, almost fabric-like texture to the jacket and bowtie, enhanced by realistic lighting that accentuates her poised stance. This emoji is ideal for celebrating formal occasions, breaking gender norms in fashion, or signifying a woman taking charge with elegance and style, reflecting the inclusive spirit of Apple."
