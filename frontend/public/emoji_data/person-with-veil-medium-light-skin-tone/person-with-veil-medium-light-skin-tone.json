The veil is depicted with soft, flowing lines and subtle highlights, suggesting a traditional or cultural covering, all enhanced by Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. This emoji conveys a sense of respect, cultural identity, or personal choice, often used in discussions related to heritage, religion, or personal expression."
