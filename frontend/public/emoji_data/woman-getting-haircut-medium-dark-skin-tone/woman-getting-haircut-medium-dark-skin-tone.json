  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji captures a woman with a medium-dark skin tone receiving a haircut, with the stylist's scissors delicately positioned near her hair, all rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. The scene is depicted with realistic lighting, highlighting the smooth, rounded edges of the figures and conveying a sense of gentle transformation. This visual on Apple devices is a dynamic and modern way to communicate changes, makeovers, or simply a trip to the salon, imbued with Apple's characteristic attention to detail."
