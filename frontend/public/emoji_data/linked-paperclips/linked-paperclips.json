Their rounded forms and precise detailing give them a tangible, almost tactile appearance, perfectly representing the concept of being joined together or associated. This emoji is frequently used to signify organization, connection, or the act of attaching and keeping items together, making it a practical and visually appealing addition to any message on Apple devices."
