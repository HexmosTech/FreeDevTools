  "description": "This version of the  Nail Polish emoji has the  Medium-light Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Cream White Skin Tone on support",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The nail polish emoji on Apple devices showcases a vibrant, glossy bottle with a rich, opaque color, reflecting Apple's meticulous attention to realistic lighting and polished finishes. The medium-light skin tone is artfully depicted as dipping a finger into the polish, with a smooth, soft application that highlights the care and detail Apple puts into its emoji designs. This emoji elegantly symbolizes beauty routines, self-care, and adding a touch of personal flair to one's style."
