  "apple_vendor_description": "The merman emoji on Apple devices presents a regal figure with a medium-light skin tone, featuring a shimmering, iridescent tail that catches the light with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading. His upper body is muscular and well-defined, with a gentle, knowing expression, enhanced by smooth gradients that give him a sense of depth and fantasy. This mythical being, as rendered on Apple devices, evokes wonder, mystery, and a connection to the enchanting depths of the ocean."
