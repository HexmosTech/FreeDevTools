  "apple_vendor_description": "The 'on' arrow emoji on Apple devices is a bold, upward-pointing indicator rendered with a vibrant, solid color and a slight 3D bevel that suggests it's ready to be activated. Its sharp, clean lines and consistent shading are hallmarks of Apple’s precise design language, emphasizing clarity and direction. This emoji is universally understood to mean 'go,' 'start,' 'play,' or to proceed with an action, making it an essential tool for guiding digital interactions."
