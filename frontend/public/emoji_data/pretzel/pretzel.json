  "apple_vendor_description": "The pretzel emoji on Apple devices is a tempting treat, rendered with a golden-brown hue and a satisfyingly chewy texture. Apple's design language imbues it with glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting, making the twisted dough appear almost edible. Its soft rounded edges and gentle curves evoke a sense of comfort and simple pleasure, perfect for conveying cravings, snacks, or a lighthearted moment of indulgence in messages."
