Its 3D design features subtle, realistic lighting that highlights the smooth contours and soft rounded edges of the palm and fingers, conveying a clear gesture of stopping or pushing away. This emoji on Apple devices is ideal for communicating a firm boundary, a polite refusal, or a directional cue with a distinct sense of presence."
