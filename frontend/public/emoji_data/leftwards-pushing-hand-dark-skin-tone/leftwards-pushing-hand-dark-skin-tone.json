  "description": "A hand pointing to the left, with a dark skin tone. Used to indicate direction, a previous item, or to push something away.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the leftwards-pushing hand emoji in a dark skin tone is rendered with a rich, deep brown hue, embodying the diversity of skin tones Apple embraces. Its 3D design features subtle, realistic lighting that highlights the smooth contours and soft rounded edges of the palm and fingers, conveying a clear gesture of stopping or pushing away. This emoji on Apple devices is ideal for communicating a firm boundary, a polite refusal, or a directional cue with a distinct sense of presence."
