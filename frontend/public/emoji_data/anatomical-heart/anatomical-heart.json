  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's anatomical heart emoji is a striking representation of the human heart, depicted with intricate detail and realistic shading that highlights its muscular structure. On Apple devices, the smooth gradients and subtle lighting give it a profound, almost medically accurate appearance, yet it retains a touch of Apple's signature warmth. This emoji is powerfully used to express deep, visceral emotions, often signifying true love, passion, or a profound connection beyond superficial affection."
