  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the low battery emoji is a stark visual indicator of dwindling power, rendered with Apple's clean, minimalist aesthetic. It typically shows a battery icon with a red or orange fill to signify its depleted state, its smooth, rounded edges giving it a modern and accessible feel. This universally understood symbol is used to communicate a need for charging or a potential interruption due to lack of power, a common digital status update on Apple devices."
