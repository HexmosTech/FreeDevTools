  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kiss between a man and woman, rendered with medium-light and medium skin tones respectively, is depicted with tender affection and soft, rounded forms. Apple's signature 3D shading creates a gentle gradient across their faces as they lean in, illuminated by a warm, realistic light that highlights their loving embrace. This emoji beautifully represents romance, intimacy, and expressions of deep love or adoration."
