You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can&rsquo;t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.</i></p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The clipboard emoji on Apple devices presents a classic, sturdy white paper held firmly by a dark, metallic clip at the top. Its design emphasizes clear, legible lines and subtle shading that suggests a tangible, professional tool for note-taking and task management. On Apple devices, it often signifies organization, to-do lists, or important information that needs to be recorded and reviewed."
