A vibrant red heart, glowing with realistic lighting and a glossy finish, floats between them, symbolizing a deep connection and love. The medium-light skin tone on one figure is depicted with a smooth gradient, conveying warmth and inclusivity in Apple's inclusive emoji set, often used to represent romantic relationships and affection."
