  "apple_vendor_description": "The Sagittarius emoji on Apple devices embodies the zodiac sign with a bold, stylized centaur archer rendered in a deep, rich bronze. Apple's signature 3D shading creates a sense of muscularity and dynamism, while realistic lighting highlights the taut bowstring and the arrow poised for flight. Its smooth, rounded edges convey both power and grace, making it a perfect symbol for adventurous spirits, optimism, and freedom of expression in digital conversations."
