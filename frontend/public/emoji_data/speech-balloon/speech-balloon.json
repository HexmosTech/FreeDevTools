  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the speech balloon emoji is rendered with a clean, crisp white fill and a deep, inviting shadow that gives it a distinct 3D presence. Its soft rounded edges and the subtle gradient contribute to a friendly and approachable feel, typical of Apple's design language. The pointed tail, sharp and distinct, clearly indicates the origin of speech or thought, making it an essential tool for conveying dialogue, ideas, or notifications. This emoji on Apple devices is a universal symbol for conversation, communication, and the sharing of information."
