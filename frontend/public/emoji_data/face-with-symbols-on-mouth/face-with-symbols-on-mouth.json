  "apple_vendor_description": "This expressive emoji on Apple devices features a bright yellow face with large, white, circular symbols covering its mouth, conveying a sense of shock, speechlessness, or an inability to express oneself. The smooth, rounded edges and subtle 3D shading characteristic of Apple’s design language give it a distinctly cartoonish yet relatable feel. It's often used digitally to communicate being overwhelmed, having something shocking happen, or being unable to find the right words to respond."
