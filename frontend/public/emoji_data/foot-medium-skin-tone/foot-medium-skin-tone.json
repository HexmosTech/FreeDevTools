  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the medium skin tone foot emoji presents a gently rounded, 3D form with subtle shading that emphasizes its natural contours.  Apple's signature glossy finish catches the light, giving it a smooth, almost tactile appearance.  This emoji, rendered with Apple's characteristic soft edges, often signifies movement, walking, or a connection to the physical world."
