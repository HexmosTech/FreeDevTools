  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s bug emoji presents a small, vibrant creature with an endearing, rounded form and a glossy finish, rendered with Apple's signature 3D shading. Its tiny antennae and segmented body are depicted with playful detail, often in a bright green or brown hue that feels both natural and charming on Apple devices. While sometimes used to represent insects, it's also playfully employed to signify a glitch, a problem, or something that needs fixing."
