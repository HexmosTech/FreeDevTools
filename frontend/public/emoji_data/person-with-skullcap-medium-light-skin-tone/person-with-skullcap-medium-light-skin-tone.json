  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person with a skullcap and medium-light skin tone is depicted with a friendly, approachable demeanor, wearing a simple, close-fitting skullcap in a muted color. Apple’s design language brings out the subtle textures and soft curves of the cap and face, enhanced by gentle gradients and realistic highlights that create a warm, inviting presence. This emoji is frequently used to represent humility, quiet contemplation, or to signify a character in a specific cultural or religious context on Apple devices."
