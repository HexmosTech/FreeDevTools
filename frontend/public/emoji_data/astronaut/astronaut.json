  "apple_vendor_description": "The astronaut emoji on Apple devices soars with a sense of wonder and exploration, clad in a detailed, textured spacesuit. Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting bring a tangible quality to the helmet's reflective visor, hinting at the vastness of space beyond. Its poised posture and determined expression convey a spirit of adventure, discovery, and reaching for the stars, making it ideal for discussions about dreams, ambitions, or the wonders of the universe."
