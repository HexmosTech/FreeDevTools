  "apple_vendor_description": "The woman supervillain emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a captivating portrayal of formidable power with a touch of dramatic flair. Her costume, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, features bold colors and sharp accents that suggest both danger and sophistication, while realistic lighting accentuates her confident, perhaps even menacing, expression. The soft, rounded edges of her design prevent her from appearing too harsh, allowing for a playful yet impactful representation of strength, defiance, or a mischievous spirit in digital communication."
