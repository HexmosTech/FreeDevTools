  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's large orange circle emoji is a bold, vibrant orb with a rich, saturated hue and a distinct, glossy sheen that catches the light. Its perfectly round form and smooth, three-dimensional appearance, achieved through Apple's signature shading and gradients, give it a sense of presence and energy. This striking emoji is often used to draw attention, represent warmth, or signify a significant point or event."
