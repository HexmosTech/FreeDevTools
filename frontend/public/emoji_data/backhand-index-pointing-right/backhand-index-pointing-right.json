  "apple_vendor_description": "The backhand index pointing right emoji on Apple devices is a sharp, clean gesture with a smooth, rounded fingertip and a subtle highlight that gives it a tactile feel.  Apple's precise rendering ensures the finger is clearly defined against any background, symbolizing direction, emphasis, or a call to attention.  It's a versatile tool in digital communication on Apple devices for guiding the eye or indicating a choice."
