  "apple_vendor_description": "The person running emoji on Apple devices captures a dynamic sense of motion with its fluid lines and energetic pose. Rendered with Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and realistic lighting, the figure appears poised mid-stride, conveying a feeling of speed and exertion. The subtle gradients and highlights enhance its three-dimensional quality, making it ideal for expressing activity, exercise, or a swift departure in digital conversations."
