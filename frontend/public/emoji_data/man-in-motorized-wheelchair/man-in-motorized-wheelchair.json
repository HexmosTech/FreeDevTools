  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man in a motorized wheelchair emoji depicts a figure with a determined yet gentle expression, seated in a modern, sleek wheelchair with realistic shading and soft rounded edges. The design emphasizes the person's independence and mobility, rendered with Apple's signature 3D depth and smooth gradients that highlight the metallic finish of the chair. This emoji is commonly used to represent inclusivity, accessibility, or personal empowerment in digital conversations."
