Apple's characteristic realistic lighting creates a polished, three-dimensional appearance, highlighting the sharp lines of the tuxedo and the smooth contours of the face. This emoji, with its elegant presentation on Apple devices, is ideal for signifying formal events, special occasions, or a sense of refined style and excitement."
