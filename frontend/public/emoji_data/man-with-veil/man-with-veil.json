  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man with veil emoji features a distinguished male figure whose face is partially obscured by a translucent veil, allowing for a sense of mystery or solemnity. Apple’s design uses soft gradients and realistic lighting to give the veil a delicate, flowing appearance, while the man's visible features hint at a thoughtful or perhaps ceremonial occasion, often used to represent religious observance or significant life events."
