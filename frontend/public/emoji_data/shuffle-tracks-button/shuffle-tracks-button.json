  "apple_vendor_description": "The shuffle tracks button emoji, as seen on Apple devices, features a sleek, modern design with two interwoven arrows, suggesting randomness and a dynamic flow. Apple’s glossy 3D shading gives the button a subtle metallic sheen, while smooth gradients and precise lighting create a sense of depth and tactility, making it appear ready to be pressed. This emoji is commonly used to indicate a desire for variety in music playback, a change of pace, or a spontaneous approach to tasks."
