  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s rendition of the 'love you' gesture emoji is a vibrant and expressive hand, formed by bringing the thumb and pinky finger outwards while the other fingers are curled inward.  The smooth, rounded edges and realistic lighting on this emoji, as seen on Apple devices, make it feel warm and approachable.  The glossy finish suggests genuine enthusiasm, making it an ideal way to send heartfelt affection and express 'I love you' in digital conversations."
