  "apple_vendor_description": "The jar emoji on Apple devices presents a clear glass container with a gentle sheen, reflecting light with a subtle, inviting glow. Its smooth, rounded edges and the visible contents within, often depicted as a preserved food or a collection of small items, speak to Apple's commitment to realistic object design. This emoji frequently represents storage, preservation, homemade goods, or a treasured collection."
