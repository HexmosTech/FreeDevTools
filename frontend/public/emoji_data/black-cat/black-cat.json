  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the black cat emoji is rendered with a sleek, obsidian coat that catches the light with subtle, glossy highlights, giving it a luxurious, 3D appearance. Its emerald green eyes, sharp and alert, gleam with an uncanny realism, perfectly embodying the mysterious and playful nature often associated with felines on Apple’s vibrant displays. This emoji on Apple devices is often used to evoke a sense of mystique, good luck (or bad luck, depending on context), or simply a fondness for our feline companions."
