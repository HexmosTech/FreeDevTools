  "description": "<p>A square or rectangular window with glass panes. Most platforms show a wooden frame with two or four panels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Used to talk about actual windows or metaphorical windows, which often represent opportunities, perspectives, or unique points of view.&nbsp;</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's window emoji offers a glimpse into a softly lit interior, framed by a cleanly designed pane with subtle reflections that convey depth and realism.  The edges of the window are rendered with Apple's characteristic soft, rounded aesthetic, and the glass itself exhibits a gentle sheen from realistic lighting.  This emoji evokes a sense of perspective, observation, or a transition between environments, inviting users to symbolize looking in, looking out, or the concept of a new view on Apple devices."
