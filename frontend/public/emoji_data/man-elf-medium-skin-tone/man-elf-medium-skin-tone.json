  "description": "A male elf with a medium skin tone, commonly used to express themes of fantasy, magic, or mythical characters.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The medium-skin-tone man elf emoji on Apple devices embodies playful fantasy with a touch of festive cheer. He sports pointed ears peeking through his wavy brown hair, a slightly upturned nose, and a warm, knowing smile, all rendered with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and realistic lighting.  His green tunic, detailed with subtle shading, suggests a connection to nature and the magical realms often associated with elves, making him a delightful choice for expressing whimsy, holiday spirit, or a hint of mischievous magic in your Apple communications."
