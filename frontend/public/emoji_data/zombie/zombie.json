  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the zombie emoji presents a distinctly ghastly figure with a pale, greenish complexion and vacant, glowing eyes.  Its tattered clothing and slightly slumped posture are depicted with a subtle 3D effect, suggesting an eerie, undead presence.  This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is often used humorously to represent feeling drained, overwhelmed, or metaphorically 'dead' after a long day."
