Their cheeks are flushed with a gentle pink, and the subtle blush indicates affection and intimacy, all conveyed with the smooth gradients and glossy highlights that define Apple's expressive emoji style.  This emoji is a powerful symbol of same-sex love and romantic connection, used to celebrate relationships and express deep affection."
