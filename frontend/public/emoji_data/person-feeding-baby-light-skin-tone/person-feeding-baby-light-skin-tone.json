The gentle curve of the person's arm supporting the baby, along with the subtle details of the feeding action, are rendered with realistic lighting, creating a palpable sense of tenderness. This emoji on Apple devices is a beautiful symbol of parenthood, family, and the act of providing sustenance and love."
