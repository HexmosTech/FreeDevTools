  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the leg emoji presents a smooth, rounded limb with subtle shading that hints at realistic form and texture. Its design, characteristic of Apple’s playful yet polished aesthetic, features soft highlights and a gentle gradient, making it appear both approachable and anatomically recognizable. This emoji is frequently used to convey movement, physical activity, or simply to represent a body part in a lighthearted or casual digital conversation."
