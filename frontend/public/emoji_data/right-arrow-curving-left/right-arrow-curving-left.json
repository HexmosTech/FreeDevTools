  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the right arrow curving left emoji is depicted as a vibrant, glossy stroke that elegantly transitions from a confident rightward direction to a graceful sweep back to the left. Its smooth gradients and precise, rounded edges convey a sense of fluid motion and deliberate redirection, a visual cue for changing course or indicating a return. This Apple-rendered icon is ideal for signaling a pivot in thought, a step backward, or navigating through options on a screen."
