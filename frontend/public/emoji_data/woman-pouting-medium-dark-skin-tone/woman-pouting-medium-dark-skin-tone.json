  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the medium-dark skin tone woman pouting emoji features a subtly downturned mouth and expressive, slightly narrowed eyes, conveying a clear sense of displeasure or disappointment. The face is rendered with Apple’s signature soft, rounded edges and realistic lighting, giving the expression a tangible depth. The smooth gradients in her skin tone add to the naturalistic and relatable portrayal of mild frustration or a playful sulk."
