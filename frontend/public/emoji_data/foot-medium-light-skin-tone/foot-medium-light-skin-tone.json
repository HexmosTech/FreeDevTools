Realistic lighting casts subtle shadows, enhancing its 3D presence and giving it a warm, organic feel. This emoji is commonly used to signify walking, movement, or to express a sense of stepping into something new, often conveying a lighthearted or casual sentiment in digital conversations on Apple devices."
