  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kiss emoji between a woman with dark skin tone and a woman with light skin tone is a tender portrayal of affection. The faces are gently angled towards each other, with soft, rounded features and subtle highlights that capture the intimacy of the moment, a hallmark of Apple's 3D design. The overall tone is one of warmth and romantic connection, with the soft blush on their cheeks adding to the loving sentiment."
