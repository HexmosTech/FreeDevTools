  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s rendition of the man with curly hair emoji features a friendly, approachable male figure with a cascade of beautifully rendered, voluminous curls that exhibit Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading. Realistic lighting highlights the texture and depth of his hair, while smooth gradients create a natural flow, and the overall form is softened by rounded edges. This emoji is often used to represent a person with this specific hairstyle or to add a touch of personality and visual interest to messages about individuals or general descriptions."
