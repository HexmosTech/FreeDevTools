The signature Apple glossy 3D shading gives his features a soft, rounded appearance, emphasizing a friendly and approachable demeanor.  This emoji, rendered with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting, conveys a sense of inclusivity and the ability to understand or communicate, often used when discussing accessibility or shared comprehension."
