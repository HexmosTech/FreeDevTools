  "description": "A man with a medium skin tone cupping his hand to his ear, indicating he is hard of hearing or deaf. This emoji can be used to represent communication challenges, or to identify someone who is deaf or hard of hearing.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the deaf man emoji presents a warm, medium skin tone, with the character's hand positioned near his ear and thumb extended, gracefully indicating understanding or communication.  The signature Apple glossy 3D shading gives his features a soft, rounded appearance, emphasizing a friendly and approachable demeanor.  This emoji, rendered with Apple's characteristic realistic lighting, conveys a sense of inclusivity and the ability to understand or communicate, often used when discussing accessibility or shared comprehension."
