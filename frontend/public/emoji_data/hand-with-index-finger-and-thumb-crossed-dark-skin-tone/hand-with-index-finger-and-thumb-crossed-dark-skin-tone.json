  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the hand with index finger and thumb crossed, in a dark skin tone, is rendered with exquisite detail and a lifelike sheen. The soft rounded edges and realistic lighting give the hand a palpable quality, with the crossed fingers appearing as a gesture of hopeful anticipation. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a warm and inclusive way to express good luck, hope, or a wish for something positive to happen."
