  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the flag of Kenya is depicted with vibrant, rich colors, showcasing a precise representation of its national emblem. The horizontal stripes of black, red, and green are separated by thin white borders, all rendered with a subtle glossy sheen characteristic of Apple's 3D design language. At the center, the Maasai shield and spears are sharply detailed, conveying national pride and heritage with a sense of authenticity and visual depth that feels distinctly Apple."
