  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's man facepalming emoji captures a universal moment of exasperation or disbelief with a subtle yet expressive gesture. The character's face, rendered with Apple's soft rounded edges and realistic lighting, conveys a clear sense of being overwhelmed or regretful. This emoji is frequently used on Apple devices to signify utter dismay, a realization of a mistake, or a feeling of 'I can't believe this is happening.'"
