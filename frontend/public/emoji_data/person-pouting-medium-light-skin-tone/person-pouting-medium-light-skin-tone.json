  "description": "This version of the  Person Pouting emoji has the  Medium-light Skin Tone applied, which is displayed as a Cream White Skin Tone on supp",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person pouting emoji with medium-light skin tone conveys a distinct sense of mild displeasure, rendered with characteristic Apple gloss and soft, rounded edges. The face features subtly downturned lips and slightly furrowed brows, designed with realistic lighting to suggest a gentle sulk rather than deep sadness. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is perfect for expressing a minor complaint, a touch of disappointment, or a playful pout in digital conversations."
