The face features subtly downturned lips and slightly furrowed brows, designed with realistic lighting to suggest a gentle sulk rather than deep sadness. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is perfect for expressing a minor complaint, a touch of disappointment, or a playful pout in digital conversations."
