  "description": "Two people holding hands, with one person having a medium-dark skin tone and the other having a dark skin tone. Represents connection, partnership, and love between individuals of different complexions.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The people holding hands emoji, as seen on Apple devices, depicts two individuals with a medium skin tone and a dark skin tone, their hands clasped in a gesture of unity and connection. Apple's characteristic smooth gradients and realistic lighting give the skin a soft, natural appearance, while the gentle curve of their joined hands and the subtle shading convey warmth and intimacy. This emoji, with its characteristic soft rounded edges, powerfully symbolizes friendship, romance, solidarity, or a strong bond between people."
