  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this expressive emoji depicts a face with wide-open, startled eyes and a soft, rounded hand gently covering the mouth. The glossy 3D rendering and subtle gradients on the skin tone evoke a sense of surprise, shock, or perhaps a hushed secret. The slightly upturned eyebrows and the gentle curve of the hand communicate a feeling of mild disbelief or an involuntary gasp, commonly used on Apple devices to express astonishment or a shared, unspoken revelation."
