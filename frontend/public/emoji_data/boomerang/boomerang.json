  "description": "<p>A wooden boomerang with bright colors on its tips. Google and Twitter&#39;s designs show motion lines to illustrate the path of a boomerang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Used literally to represent a boomerang. Also used to represent Aboriginal people or Australia in general. May be used to represent something that comes back or returns.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s rendition of the boomerang emoji showcases a classic, curved throwing stick, rendered with a polished wooden texture and subtle highlights that accentuate its smooth, aerodynamic shape. The realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges on this Apple device exclusive design give it a tangible, almost tactile quality. It elegantly symbolizes return, persistence, or the idea of something coming back full circle in a message."
