  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kiss between a man and woman emoji showcases a tender moment with distinct skin tones – a medium skin tone for the man and a medium-dark skin tone for the woman, both rendered with Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and realistic lighting. Their faces are close, eyes often depicted as closed in affection, with subtle blush tones adding to the romantic visual. This emoji on Apple devices beautifully symbolizes love, romance, and intimate connection."
