  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the tangerine emoji is a vibrant burst of citrus, rendered with a rich, textured peel that appears juicy and ripe, thanks to Apple’s realistic lighting and subtle glossy 3D shading. Its soft rounded edges give it a plump, inviting appearance, and the bright orange hue is instantly recognizable and cheerful. This emoji evokes feelings of freshness, sweetness, and a delightful zesty flavor, commonly used to add a touch of natural goodness or a bright, sunny disposition to messages."
