  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the X-ray emoji presents a crisp, white skeletal structure against a deep, almost black background, emphasizing clarity and precision. The bones are rendered with Apple's signature smooth gradients and subtle 3D shading, suggesting a scientific and analytical examination. This emoji is often used in contexts related to health, medicine, or to metaphorically 'see through' a situation on Apple devices."
