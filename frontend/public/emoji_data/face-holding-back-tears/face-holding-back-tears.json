  "apple_vendor_description": "The face holding back tears emoji on Apple devices presents a classic yellow face with wide, slightly downturned eyes and a furrowed brow, conveying a strong sense of suppressed emotion. Its signature Apple 3D shading adds a subtle sheen, highlighting the glistening tears held just at the brink of falling. This emoji masterfully captures the feeling of being overwhelmed, embarrassed, or deeply touched, often used when trying to maintain composure despite strong feelings."
