  "apple_vendor_description": "The light bulb emoji on Apple devices glows with a bright, optimistic energy, rendered in Apple's signature style with a glossy, transparent glass casing. Inside, a stylized filament hints at illumination, all brought to life with realistic lighting and soft, rounded edges that give it a modern, approachable feel. This emoji symbolizes ideas, inspiration, innovation, and moments of sudden understanding, often used to express a brilliant thought or a solution."
