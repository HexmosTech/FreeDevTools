  "description": "The Man Gesturing Not OK, Type-3 emoji is a sequence of the  Face With No Good Gesture,  Emoji Modifier Fitzpatrick Type-3, ? Male Sign",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The man gesturing no emoji on Apple devices, in its medium-light skin tone variation, portrays a clear gesture of refusal or negation with expressive nuance. The man's head is slightly tilted, and his hand is raised with palm facing outward, a universally understood sign for 'stop' or 'no', all crafted with Apple's signature smooth gradients and realistic lighting that give the figure a tangible presence. His facial expression, though subtle, conveys a firm but polite rejection, making it ideal for politely declining an offer or indicating disagreement on Apple devices."
