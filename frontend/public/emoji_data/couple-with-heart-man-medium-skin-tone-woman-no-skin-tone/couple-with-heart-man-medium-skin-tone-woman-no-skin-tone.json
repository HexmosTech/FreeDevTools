  "description": "Represents a romantic couple, specifically a woman with no specific skin tone and a man with medium skin tone, united by a heart symbol. It signifies love, partnership, and affection between two people, with a focus on the man's medium skin tone.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the couple with a heart, featuring a man with medium skin tone and a woman with no skin tone, depicts a loving union with warmth and simplicity. Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges and realistic lighting bring the figures to life, subtly conveying their connection through their proximity and the prominent heart. The smooth gradients and gentle 3D shading on the man's skin tone, juxtaposed with the stylized woman, make this emoji a universally understood symbol of romantic partnership and affection."
