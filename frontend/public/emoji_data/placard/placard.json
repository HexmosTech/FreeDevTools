  "description": "<p>A sign on a post, commonly used to promote ideas, causes, or make announcements. Often used used in the context of politics to represent a lawn sign or a poster brought to a protest. Also seen in commercial advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shown with indiscernible writing or not writing at all, this emoji is flexible in its use. WhatsApp shows a peace sign, which tilts the meaning away from commercial use.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the placard emoji presents as a crisp, white rectangular sign with subtly rounded corners, embodying Apple's signature clean and modern aesthetic.  Its slightly raised appearance and soft, diffused shadow suggest it’s ready to display important information or announcements, conveying a sense of official communication or a clear directive within digital conversations."
