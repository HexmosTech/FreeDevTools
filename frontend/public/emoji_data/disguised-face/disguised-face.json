  "description": "<p>A yellow face with big glasses, a large nose, thick eyebrows, and a mustache. Used to represent someone in disguise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The features of this particular disguised face are taken from the &ldquo;Groucho Mask&rdquo; or &ldquo;Groucho Glasses,&rdquo; designed in the likeness of the caricature played by Julius Henry Marx in the Marx Brothers&#39; films. These comedic films were popular in the 1930s and &lsquo;40s, and the mask has been a mainstay of joke shops since <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/18/books/there-ain-t-no-sanity-claus.html\">as early as the 1940s</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other emoji faces in disguise include <a href=\"/superhero/\">🦸 Superhero</a> and <a href=\"/supervillain/\">🦹 Supervillain</a>.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The disguised face emoji on Apple devices presents a whimsical character peeking out from behind a large, dark-rimmed pair of spectacles and a wide, red nose. Its subtle 3D shading and smooth gradients give it a playful, cartoonish feel, while the slightly angled head suggests a mischievous peek. This emoji is perfect for conveying a sense of secrecy, impersonation, or playful deception in your digital conversations on Apple devices."
