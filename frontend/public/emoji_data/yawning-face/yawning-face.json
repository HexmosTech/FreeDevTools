  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the yawning face emoji displays a distinctly tired yet amiable expression, with eyes squeezed shut and a wide, relaxed mouth caught mid-yawn. The characteristic soft rounded edges and subtle, warm skin tones contribute to its relatable portrayal of fatigue or boredom. This emoji, rendered with Apple's realistic lighting, effectively communicates a feeling of sleepiness, disinterest, or the need for a break in digital conversations."
