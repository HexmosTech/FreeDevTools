  "description": "<p>A yellow face with eyes closed and mouth wide open covered by a hand. Captured mid-yawn, this may represent having insufficient sleep, or to imply boredom with a person or topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not to be confused with&nbsp;<a href=\"/sleepy-face/\">😪 Sleepy Face</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"/sleeping-face/\">😴 Sleeping Face</a>, which often convey actually being asleep, or&nbsp;<a href=\"/tired-face/\">😫 Tired Face</a> which is tired as in &quot;fed up&quot;.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the yawning face emoji displays a distinctly tired yet amiable expression, with eyes squeezed shut and a wide, relaxed mouth caught mid-yawn. The characteristic soft rounded edges and subtle, warm skin tones contribute to its relatable portrayal of fatigue or boredom. This emoji, rendered with Apple's realistic lighting, effectively communicates a feeling of sleepiness, disinterest, or the need for a break in digital conversations."
