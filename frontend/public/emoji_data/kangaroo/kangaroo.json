  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kangaroo emoji bounds forward with a lively posture, its brown fur rendered with soft, rounded edges and a subtle, realistic texture that is a hallmark of Apple's 3D design. The dynamic pose and bright, natural lighting give it a sense of energy and movement. This charming emoji, appearing with characteristic vibrancy on Apple devices, is a fun way to represent Australia, hopping, or a playful leap of excitement in messages."
