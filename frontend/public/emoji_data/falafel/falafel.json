  "description": "<p>Brown spheres depicting falafel, a food popular in Middle Eastern and North African cuisine, typically made of mashed chickpeas or fava beans. Most platforms include three or more falafel with one piece split open to reveal a green center. Can be used to talk about falafel&nbsp;and possibly other round brown food items like meatballs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On several&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;<a href=\"/stuffed-flatbread/\">🥙 Stuffed Flatbread</a>&nbsp;appears to be filled with falafel, so for some users, these two emoji might be interchangeable.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The falafel emoji on Apple devices presents a delightful, golden-brown sphere with a slightly textured surface, hinting at its savory deliciousness. Rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and soft gradients, it appears warm and inviting, as if freshly prepared. This emoji is a vibrant representation of Middle Eastern cuisine, often used to express cravings for comfort food, discuss meals, or share culinary discoveries."
