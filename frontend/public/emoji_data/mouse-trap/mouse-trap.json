A wedge of <a href=\"/cheese-wedge/\">cheese</a> is used to lure a mouse into the box, knocking the stick away and trapping &mdash; but not killing &mdash; the mouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is distinct from other traps which kill or injure upon capture.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Rendered with precise detail on Apple devices, the mouse-trap emoji presents a classic wooden snap trap with a polished, slightly aged finish. Its metallic spring mechanism and bait tray are sharply defined, showcasing Apple's commitment to realistic textures and lighting effects. On Apple devices, this emoji can humorously suggest a trap, a difficult situation, or even a clever solution to a problem, often used with a touch of wit."
