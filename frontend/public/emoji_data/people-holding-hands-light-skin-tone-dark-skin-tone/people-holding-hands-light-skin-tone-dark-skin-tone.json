  "description": "Represents a couple or group of people with light and dark skin tones holding hands, symbolizing unity, love, diversity, and connection.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "This touching emoji on Apple devices captures the essence of unity and friendship, featuring two hands clasped together, one rendered with a light skin tone and the other with a deep dark skin tone. Apple's meticulous 3D shading and polished finish lend a realistic texture to the skin tones, while subtle highlights and soft gradients create a tangible sense of connection.  The smooth, rounded contours of the hands and fingers convey warmth, support, and a strong bond, making it a versatile symbol for camaraderie, alliance, or shared journeys."
