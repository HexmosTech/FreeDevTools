  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman guard emoji with a dark skin tone stands tall and poised, embodying vigilance and authority through Apple’s characteristic 3D rendering and smooth gradients. Her uniform is depicted with meticulous detail, featuring realistic lighting that highlights the fabric's texture and the gleam of any insignia, all softened by Apple’s signature rounded edges. This emoji conveys a sense of protection, responsibility, and strength, often used to represent security or someone in a position of oversight."
