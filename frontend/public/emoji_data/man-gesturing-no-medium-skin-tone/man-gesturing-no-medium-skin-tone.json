  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this man's gesture of refusal is depicted with a clear, medium skin tone and a friendly, yet firm, expression. His head is slightly tilted, and his arm is raised with his palm facing outwards, conveying a polite but definitive 'no.' Apple’s signature smooth gradients and soft rounded edges lend a realistic and approachable feel to his appearance, making this emoji perfect for politely declining an offer or indicating disagreement in digital conversations."
