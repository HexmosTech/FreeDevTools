  "apple_vendor_description": "The kiss person: man, light skin tone, no skin tone emoji on Apple devices captures a tender moment, with a man of light skin tone leaning in for a kiss. Apple's design imbues this emoji with a soft, romantic glow, utilizing subtle gradients and realistic lighting to highlight the gentle expression and the implied movement. The rounded edges of the figures and the overall smooth, polished finish are hallmarks of Apple's emoji aesthetic, making it ideal for expressing affection, love, or a sweet romantic gesture."
