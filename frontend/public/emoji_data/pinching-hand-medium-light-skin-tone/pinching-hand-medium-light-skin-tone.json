  "description": "A hand with the thumb and index finger pinched together, often used to indicate a small amount, a precise measurement, or a subtle hint. The medium-light skin tone variation.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the pinching hand emoji is meticulously crafted with a medium-light skin tone, showcasing Apple‚Äôs signature realistic lighting and smooth, subtle gradients that give it a tactile, three-dimensional quality. The thumb and index finger are brought together in a precise pinch, with a slight curvature and soft rounded edges that enhance its delicate yet defined appearance. This emoji, with its nuanced rendering on Apple‚Äôs displays, is commonly used to convey a small amount, a hint of something, or to playfully suggest something is just right."
