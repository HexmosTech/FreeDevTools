  "apple_vendor_description": "The fast-forward button on Apple devices is rendered as a sleek, geometric arrow pointing upwards, conveying a sense of rapid ascent and progress. Its design features Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, with subtle highlights and shadows that give it a polished, tactile feel. This emoji on Apple devices is commonly used to signify moving forward quickly, skipping ahead, or achieving a goal with speed and efficiency."
