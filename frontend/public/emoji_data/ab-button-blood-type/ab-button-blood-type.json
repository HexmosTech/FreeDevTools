  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's AB blood type emoji is a clean, clinical representation, appearing as a smooth, slightly raised button with the letters 'AB' rendered in crisp white against a deep red background. The glossy finish and subtle 3D shading on Apple devices give it a polished, medical feel, symbolizing this specific blood group. It's a concise way to communicate blood type information within Apple's ecosystem, often used in health-related contexts or personal profiles."
