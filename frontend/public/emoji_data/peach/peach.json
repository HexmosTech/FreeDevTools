  "apple_vendor_description": "The peach emoji on Apple devices is a plump, perfectly ripe fruit, rendered with vibrant, juicy colors and a soft, inviting texture. Apple’s characteristic glossy 3D shading gives it a delightful, almost tangible feel, with realistic lighting catching its delicate fuzz and subtle contours. This sweet and summery emoji is often used to convey deliciousness, attractiveness, or a sense of abundance, bringing a touch of natural sweetness to your messages on Apple devices."
