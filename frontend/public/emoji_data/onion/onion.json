  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple’s onion emoji presents a perfectly spherical bulb with distinct, layered skin rendered in earthy brown and tan hues. The realistic lighting and subtle gloss on its surface, characteristic of Apple's 3D design, give it a fresh, organic appearance, while soft rounded edges make it inviting. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is a clear and vibrant symbol for cooking, ingredients, and healthy eating, adding a touch of culinary flair to messages."
