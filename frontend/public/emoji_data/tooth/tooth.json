  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the tooth emoji is a bright, clean, and perfectly formed enamel structure, shining with a subtle gloss.  Its smooth, rounded edges and the gentle play of light across its surface highlight Apple's commitment to detailed, almost photorealistic 3D design.  This emoji clearly symbolizes dental health, oral hygiene, or even a bright, healthy smile, making it a straightforward and positive visual element."
