  "description": "A person with a medium-dark skin tone cupping their hand to their ear, indicating they are hard of hearing or deaf. This emoji can be used to represent communication challenges, or to identify someone who is deaf or hard of hearing.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The deaf person emoji, presented in a rich medium-dark skin tone on Apple devices, portrays a person with their hand gently touching their ear, conveying understanding and communication beyond sound. Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft lighting give this figure a compassionate and approachable appearance, highlighting the nuances of non-auditory communication. It serves as an important symbol of inclusion, empathy, and the diversity of human experience in digital discourse."
