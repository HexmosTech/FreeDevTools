  "apple_vendor_description": "The 'see no evil' monkey emoji on Apple devices presents a charming, rounded simian with a gentle, serene expression, its hands gracefully covering its eyes.  Rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and soft, rounded edges, it appears to be a plush toy, bathed in realistic, warm lighting.  This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, conveys a sense of innocence, discretion, or a playful refusal to acknowledge something, often used to express a desire for peace or to avoid unpleasant sights."
