  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this man’s pout is rendered with subtle yet expressive detail, his medium-dark skin tone given a smooth, realistic texture.  The slightly downturned mouth and furrowed brow, characteristic of Apple’s thoughtful emoji design, convey a distinct sense of displeasure or mild annoyance.  Its glossy 3D shading and soft rounded edges make him appear almost animated, a perfect visual shorthand for a moment of playful sulking or gentle complaint in digital conversations."
