  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the otter emoji is a delightful and playful creature, depicted with sleek, wet-looking fur and bright, curious eyes. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients give the otter a wonderfully tactile and realistic feel, capturing its aquatic agility. This charming emoji often represents playfulness, joy, curiosity, or a connection to nature and water environments."
