  "apple_vendor_description": "The flag of U.S. Outlying Islands, as rendered on Apple devices, features crisp, bold stripes and stars with a subtle sense of dimensionality thanks to Appleâ€™s 3D shading and soft gradients. The fabric appears to ripple slightly, adding a touch of realism and pride to its presentation. This emoji is a specific national symbol, often used in contexts related to geography, travel, or specific regional affiliations."
