Its walls appear faded, the roof slightly askew, and the windows dark and vacant, all rendered with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and subdued lighting to emphasize its aged condition. This emoji can symbolize neglect, decay, or a place that has seen better days, often used to evoke a feeling of melancholy or nostalgia."
