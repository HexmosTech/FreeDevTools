  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the person in the lotus position emoji is a serene figure, their form rendered with Apple’s characteristic soft, rounded edges and subtle, realistic lighting.  The gentle curves of their body convey a sense of peace and deep concentration, with a focus on the meditative posture.  This emoji is commonly used to represent mindfulness, yoga, meditation, or a state of calm and inner balance."
