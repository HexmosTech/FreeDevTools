  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's bagel emoji is a delightfully textured representation, featuring a golden-brown, slightly uneven surface with visible sesame seeds scattered across its glossy exterior. The soft, rounded shape and the subtle highlights from realistic lighting give it a warm and inviting appearance, characteristic of Apple's food emoji designs. This emoji is commonly used to represent breakfast, a simple snack, or to share a craving for this beloved baked good on Apple devices."
