  "apple_vendor_description": "The grey heart emoji on Apple devices is a sophisticated and understated symbol, rendered with a matte finish and subtle, realistic lighting that gives it a refined depth. Its soft rounded edges and muted tone, characteristic of Apple's design, evoke a sense of calm, neutrality, or even a gentle melancholy. On Apple devices, this emoji is frequently used to express a more subdued affection, a sense of solidarity, or a calm acknowledgment in digital communication."
