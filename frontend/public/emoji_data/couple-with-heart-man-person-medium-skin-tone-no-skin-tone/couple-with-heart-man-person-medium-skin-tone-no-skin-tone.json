  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the couple with heart emoji, specifically a man and a person with a medium skin tone and no skin tone variation, presents a warm and harmonious union. The figures are depicted with Apple's characteristic soft, rounded edges and subtle 3D shading, creating a sense of closeness and affection. A gently rendered, rosy heart floats between them, its glossy surface catching the light, symbolizing love, partnership, and a shared bond in digital communications on Apple devices."
