  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the man dancing emoji, with light skin tone, exudes pure exhilaration and movement. The figure is captured mid-leap, limbs gracefully extended, with dynamic lighting and soft rounded edges that give it a lively, almost animated feel. On Apple devices, this emoji is a fantastic way to convey celebration, joy, and an infectious sense of fun."
