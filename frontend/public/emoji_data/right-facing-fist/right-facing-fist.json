  "apple_vendor_description": "The right-facing fist emoji on Apple devices is depicted with a strong, confident posture, rendered in a warm, medium skin tone. Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading gives it a sense of solid mass and power, with realistic lighting catching the knuckles and contours. Its soft rounded edges ensure it feels approachable yet firm, commonly used to signify agreement, solidarity, support, or a celebratory 'fist bump' in conversations across Apple platforms."
