  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the backhand index pointing down emoji is rendered with a sharp, decisive gesture, the finger extending downwards with clear intent. Apple's design gives the hand a polished, realistic texture, with subtle shading and a firm, rounded tip that emphasizes its directional cue. This emoji is commonly used to draw attention to something below the message, indicate a downward trend, or emphatically direct the recipient's gaze."
