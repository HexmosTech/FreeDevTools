  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the Pisces emoji is a beautifully stylized representation of the two fish swimming in opposite directions, rendered with Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading and vibrant, aquatic blues. The soft, rounded forms of the fish and the gentle flow of their movement evoke a sense of duality and intuition characteristic of the Pisces zodiac sign. This emoji is a beloved symbol for those born under its sign, expressing empathy, creativity, and a deep connection to the emotional world."
