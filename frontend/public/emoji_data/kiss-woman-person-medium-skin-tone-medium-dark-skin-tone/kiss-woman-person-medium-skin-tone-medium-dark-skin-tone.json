  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kiss between a woman and a person with a medium-dark skin tone is depicted with tender affection and nuanced skin tones that reflect Apple's inclusive design philosophy. Soft gradients and realistic lighting give the figures a warm, almost tangible presence, their faces gently angled towards each other in a loving embrace, outlined with Apple's characteristic smooth rounded edges. This emoji beautifully symbolizes romance, deep connection, or a heartfelt goodbye, adding a personal and loving touch to digital conversations on Apple devices."
