  "apple_vendor_description": "The petri dish emoji on Apple devices appears as a perfectly transparent disc filled with a subtle, translucent medium, sitting atop a base with soft, rounded edges. Apple's design emphasizes realistic lighting and subtle reflections, making it look both sterile and scientifically precise. This emoji on Apple devices is commonly used to represent science, research, biology, or experiments, perfect for discussions in educational or laboratory contexts."
