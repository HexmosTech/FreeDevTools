Apple's signature 3D shading and realistic lighting bring a sense of gravitas and character to his facial features, while the soft, rounded edges of his form exude approachability. This emoji often symbolizes wisdom, experience, or a respected elder figure, adding a nuanced representation of age and heritage to digital communication."
