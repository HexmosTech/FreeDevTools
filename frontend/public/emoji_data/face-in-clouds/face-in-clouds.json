  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the face in clouds emoji presents a serene, almost ethereal countenance peeking through soft, billowing white clouds. Apple’s signature glossy 3D shading and gentle gradients create a dreamlike atmosphere, suggesting a state of blissful distraction or a moment of profound thought. This emoji is perfectly rendered on Apple devices to convey feelings of being lost in thought, daydreaming, or experiencing a moment of pure, unadulterated peace."
