  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this emoji beautifully depicts two individuals with distinct skin tones, one dark and one medium, holding hands with a gentle, supportive grip. The Apple design imbues their hands with soft, rounded edges and subtle 3D shading, creating a feeling of connection and unity.  Realistic lighting catches the contours, emphasizing the smooth gradients that define their skin, making it a versatile symbol of partnership, friendship, or shared experiences in digital communication."
