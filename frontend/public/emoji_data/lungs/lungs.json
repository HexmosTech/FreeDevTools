Sometimes used in reference to taking deep breaths, hyperventilating, or breathing in general. Also used in the context of smoking or vaping.</p>",
  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendering of the lungs emoji presents a pair of healthy, pinkish-red organs with remarkably detailed texture and subtle depth, achieved through smooth gradients and realistic lighting.  The organ's form is presented with Apple's characteristic soft rounded edges, making it appear both organic and visually appealing.  This emoji is frequently used to symbolize health, breathing, physical fitness, or medical conditions and awareness campaigns on Apple devices."
