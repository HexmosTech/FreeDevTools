  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the smiling face with hearts emoji radiates pure joy and adoration, depicted with a bright, rosy blush and eyes crinkled in happiness.  The surrounding hearts, rendered in a vibrant pink and red with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading, seem to float around the cheerful countenance, creating a sense of overwhelming affection. This emoji, with its soft rounded edges and realistic lighting, perfectly captures the feeling of being completely smitten or deeply appreciative in digital conversations."
