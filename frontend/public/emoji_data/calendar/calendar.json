  "apple_vendor_description": "The calendar emoji on Apple devices is a neatly rendered square or rectangular block, typically displaying a specific date with clear, legible numerals and often a prominent day of the week. Apple's signature glossy finish and soft rounded edges give it a clean, modern, and tactile feel, implying organization and planning. It’s a go-to emoji for scheduling events, referencing dates, or reminding someone of an appointment."
