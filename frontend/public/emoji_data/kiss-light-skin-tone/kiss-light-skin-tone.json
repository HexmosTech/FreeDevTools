  "description": "A face blowing a kiss, often with closed eyes and a rosy cheek, signifying affection, love, or a playful farewell.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the kiss emoji with light skin tone is a tender representation, featuring a pair of lips puckered slightly and often colored in a soft rosy hue, enhanced by Apple’s signature glossy finish and realistic lighting. The smooth, rounded contours of the lips convey warmth and affection, embodying a gentle expression of love or a sweet farewell. This emoji is a classic way to send a romantic sentiment or a friendly peck in digital conversations."
