  "description": "A hand with all five fingers spread open, often used to indicate 'stop', 'talk to the hand', or a five-count. The light skin tone specifies the complexion.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the hand with splayed fingers in a light skin tone radiates a warm, inviting energy, its five digits spread wide as if in a welcoming gesture. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading imbues it with realistic depth and soft rounded edges, making it appear almost tangible. This emoji, with its subtle highlights and smooth gradients, is commonly used on Apple devices to signify openness, a high-five, or a general greeting, conveying enthusiasm and approachability."
