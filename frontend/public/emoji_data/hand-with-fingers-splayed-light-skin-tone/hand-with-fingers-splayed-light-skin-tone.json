Apple's signature glossy 3D shading imbues it with realistic depth and soft rounded edges, making it appear almost tangible. This emoji, with its subtle highlights and smooth gradients, is commonly used on Apple devices to signify openness, a high-five, or a general greeting, conveying enthusiasm and approachability."
