  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the woman raising her hand with a light skin tone emoji presents an active, engaged gesture. Her arm is extended upwards with a bright, friendly expression, brought to life by Apple's characteristic 3D rendering and soft, rounded edges. The realistic lighting on her skin tone and hair gives the emoji a dynamic and approachable feel, commonly used on Apple devices to signify a question, a desire to speak, or enthusiastic participation."
