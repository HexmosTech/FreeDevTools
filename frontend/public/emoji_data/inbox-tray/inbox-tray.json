  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the inbox tray emoji is presented as a sleek, modern receptacle, typically rendered in a clean, professional gray with a subtle metallic sheen. Apple's design emphasizes its functionality with crisp lines and a clear sense of depth, suggesting a place where important items are collected. The soft, rounded corners of the tray and the gentle shading give it an approachable yet efficient look, commonly used to represent incoming messages, new mail, or a collection point for information."
