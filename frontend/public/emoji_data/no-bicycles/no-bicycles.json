  "apple_vendor_description": "The 'no bicycles' emoji on Apple devices presents a vibrant red circle, a universal symbol of prohibition, overlaid with a stark white diagonal line. Within this striking frame, a beautifully rendered bicycle, showcasing Apple's signature smooth gradients and soft rounded edges, is depicted with a subtle 3D sheen. This clear visual cue, designed with Apple's characteristic attention to detail, instantly conveys a message of restriction or a designated area where cycling is not permitted, often used in signage or to communicate rules."
