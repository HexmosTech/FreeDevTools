  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's Double Curly Loop emoji is a visually dynamic and playful symbol, appearing as two intertwined, vibrant loops with distinct, soft rounded edges. On Apple devices, the loops exhibit a delightful dimensionality, thanks to the realistic lighting and smooth gradients that give them a bouncy, almost tangible quality. This emoji often signifies excitement, enthusiasm, or a sense of fun and whimsy, adding a burst of energy and joyful emphasis to messages."
