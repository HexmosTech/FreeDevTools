  "apple_vendor_description": "The medium skin tone rightwards hand emoji on Apple devices is a bold and unambiguous pointer, its palm facing forward and fingers aligned to direct attention to the right. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients give this hand a polished, almost three-dimensional quality, with subtle highlights that emphasize its form. This emoji on Apple devices is a clear and concise way to guide the eye, indicate direction, or emphasize a point in digital communication."
