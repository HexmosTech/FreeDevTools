His spacesuit is rendered with Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading, featuring realistic lighting that highlights the smooth, rounded curves of the helmet and suit.  The subtle gleam on the visor and the overall polished finish evoke the spirit of discovery, ambition, and venturing into the unknown."
