  "apple_vendor_description": "The man with beard emoji on Apple devices showcases a distinguished gentleman with a full, well-defined beard. Its Apple design features realistic lighting that accentuates the texture of the beard, giving it a soft yet substantial look, all within a smooth, rounded facial structure. The overall impression is one of maturity, wisdom, or a classic masculine aesthetic, often used to represent a person with facial hair or a generally more traditional male figure."
