The glossy 3D shading and smooth gradients on Apple devices give the flag a polished, almost tactile appearance, suggesting national pride and vibrant energy. This emoji is a clear symbol of Chile, its heritage, and is frequently used to express connections to the country or to celebrate Chilean culture."
