  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the woman shrugging emoji with a dark skin tone conveys a sense of uncertainty or indifference with a distinctive Apple flair. Her arms are raised outwards, palms facing up, in a gesture of 'I don't know,' rendered with Apple's signature soft rounded edges and subtle 3D shading. The realistic lighting across her features and clothing adds a touch of nuance, making her expression approachable and relatable in digital conversations on Apple devices. This emoji is a versatile tool for expressing bewilderment, a lack of knowledge, or a casual dismissal in texts and social media."
