The smooth, glossy finish and realistic lighting on Apple devices highlight the gentle curves of the figure submerged in water, evoking a sense of serene privacy. This emoji, with its emphasis on soft gradients and rounded forms, is a perfect representation of unwinding, self-indulgence, and the simple pleasure of a refreshing soak."
