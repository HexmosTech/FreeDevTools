  "apple_vendor_description": "The goblin emoji on Apple devices presents a mischievous and slightly unsettling character, rendered with Apple's characteristic depth and detail through glossy 3D shading and subtle lighting. Its sharp features and slightly contorted posture, framed by smooth, rounded edges, give it a unique personality that hints at folklore and fantasy. On Apple devices, this emoji often signifies playful trickery, a sense of the uncanny, or a reference to mythical creatures and fantastical stories."
