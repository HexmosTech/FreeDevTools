Depicted as a gray&nbsp;stone carving of a stylized human head with a prominent brow and nose, most often facing left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes used for various idiosyncratic purposes, such as conveying a stoic, deadpan, or silly expression. For example, this emoji is often used to represent various &quot;sigma&quot; or &quot;chad&quot; memes due to its chiselled emotionaless features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its official Unicode name of <em>Moyai&nbsp;</em>and inclusion in early Japanese emoji sets, such as from au by KDDI, suggest&nbsp;the emoji may represent the <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g1066456-d1953259-Reviews-Moyai_Statue-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html\">Moyai Statue</a> near Shibuya Station in Tokyo, Japan; previous designs from <a href=\"/google/android-4.3/moai/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"/microsoft/windows-8.0/moai/\">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;resemble the Tokyo statue.

  "apple_vendor_description": "The Moai emoji on Apple devices features a stoic, gray stone head with a distinctively solemn expression, rendered with Apple's signature deep 3D shading and subtle highlights. Its form is robust and imposing, with softly rounded contours that give it a surprisingly friendly presence despite its ancient origins. This emoji is often used humorously to represent contemplation, stubbornness, silence, or a sense of being overwhelmed."
