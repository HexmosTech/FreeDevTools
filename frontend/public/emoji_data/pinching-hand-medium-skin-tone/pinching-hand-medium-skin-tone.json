  "description": "A hand with the thumb and index finger pinched together, often used to indicate a small amount, a precise measurement, or a subtle hint. The medium skin tone variation.",
  "apple_vendor_description": "The pinching hand emoji on Apple devices, shown with a medium skin tone, is depicted with a delicate curve and precise detail, as if gently gathering a small amount. Apple's signature glossy 3D shading gives the fingertips a lifelike appearance, with soft highlights and smooth gradients emphasizing its tactile nature. This gesture, rendered with Apple's characteristic attention to detail, often conveys a sense of 'just a little bit,' precision, or a subtle request."
