  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the left-facing fist emoji is a robust symbol of solidarity and empowerment, rendered with bold, defined lines and subtle shading that gives it a strong, tactile presence.  The smooth, rounded knuckles and the slight sheen from Apple's realistic lighting contribute to its impactful, three-dimensional look.  This emoji, with its confident posture, is frequently used to express support, agreement, a show of strength, or as a sign of unity in digital conversations."
