  "apple_vendor_description": "The handshake emoji with a medium-dark skin tone, as seen on Apple devices, beautifully captures a moment of agreement and connection. The hands are rendered with realistic texture and lighting, featuring Apple's characteristic glossy sheen and soft, rounded edges. This emoji powerfully symbolizes trust, partnership, collaboration, and the sealing of a deal, conveying a sense of solidarity and mutual respect."
