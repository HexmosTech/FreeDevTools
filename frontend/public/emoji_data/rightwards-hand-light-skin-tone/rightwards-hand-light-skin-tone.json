  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the rightwards hand with a light skin tone points decisively forward, rendered with Apple's signature glossy 3D shading that emphasizes its smooth, rounded contours. Realistic lighting casts subtle shadows, giving the palm and fingers a lifelike dimensionality. This emoji on Apple devices is a versatile symbol for direction, pointing to something specific, or indicating agreement and approval."
