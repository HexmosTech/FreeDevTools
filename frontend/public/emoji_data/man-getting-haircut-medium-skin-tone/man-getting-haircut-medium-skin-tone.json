  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the man getting haircut emoji with a medium skin tone captures a moment of personal grooming with subtle detail and soft gradients. The barber's scissors and comb are rendered with a touch of gloss, while the man's expression suggests a calm or perhaps slightly amused acceptance of the trim. This Apple emoji effectively communicates themes of self-care, change, or simply a visit to the salon or barber."
