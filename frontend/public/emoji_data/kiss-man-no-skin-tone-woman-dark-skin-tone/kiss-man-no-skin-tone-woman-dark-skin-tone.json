  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, this intimate emoji depicts a man with no discernible skin tone and a woman with a dark skin tone leaning in for a tender kiss, their features softened by Apple's characteristic glossy 3D shading and realistic lighting. A soft pink blush emanates from their cheeks, and a subtle heart floats near them, radiating romance and affection. This emoji, with its smooth curves and gentle glow on Apple devices, perfectly encapsulates a moment of passionate love."
