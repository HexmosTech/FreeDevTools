  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's rendition of the man pouting emoji, with a dark skin tone, showcases a subtly downturned mouth and a slightly furrowed brow, conveying a mild displeasure or sulkiness with Apple's characteristic smooth gradients. The facial features are rendered with soft, rounded edges, giving the character an approachable yet clearly unhappy expression. On Apple devices, this emoji is ideal for communicating a gentle complaint, a touch of playful annoyance, or a moment of quiet disappointment."
