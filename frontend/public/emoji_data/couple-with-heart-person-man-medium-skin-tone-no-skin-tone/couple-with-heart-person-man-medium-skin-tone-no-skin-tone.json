  "apple_vendor_description": "The 'Couple with Heart (Person, Man)' emoji on Apple devices represents a loving relationship where one figure is depicted as a person (gender-neutral) and the other as a man with a medium skin tone. Appleâ€™s signature glossy 3D shading gives the figures a smooth, tactile appearance, while realistic lighting emphasizes their closeness.  The centrally placed, glowing heart, rendered with Apple's characteristic softness, powerfully communicates love, romance, and the unique connection between partners in communication on Apple devices."
