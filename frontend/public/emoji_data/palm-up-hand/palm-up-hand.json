  "apple_vendor_description": "Apple's palm-up hand emoji is rendered with a gentle, upward curve, its surface subtly reflecting light with characteristic Apple gloss and 3D shading. The hand’s skin tone appears natural and warm, with soft, rounded fingers conveying an open and welcoming gesture. On Apple devices, this emoji signifies offering, asking, praying, or a general sense of openness and receptiveness, beautifully captured with Apple's refined visual style."
