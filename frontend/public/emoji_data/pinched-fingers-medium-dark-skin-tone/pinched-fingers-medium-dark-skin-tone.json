  "apple_vendor_description": "On Apple devices, the pinched fingers emoji, rendered with a medium-dark skin tone, conveys a subtle yet expressive gesture with precise detail. The fingers are slightly curved, with a realistic texture and subtle shading that gives them a tactile feel, a signature of Apple's 3D emoji design. This emoji, as seen on Apple devices, is often used humorously to represent 'just a pinch,' or to emphasize a small amount of something, adding a playful nuance to digital communication."
