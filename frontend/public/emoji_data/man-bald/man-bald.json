  "apple_vendor_description": "The bald man emoji on Apple devices presents a friendly, approachable visage with smooth, rounded contours and subtle shading that suggests a well-defined head shape.  His expression is neutral yet inviting, rendered with Apple's signature realistic lighting and soft gradients, conveying a sense of maturity and presence. This emoji is often employed to represent men, individuals without hair, or simply to add a human element to conversations on Apple devices."
