It's really the architecture design and simplicity that has been the initial focus.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of some of the tools registered with Maya MCP.\r\n\r\n## Basic Tools\r\n\r\n| Tool | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| list_objects_by_type | Get a list of objects in the scene. Use filter_by to filter for certain objects such as \"cameras\", \"lights\", \"materials\", or \"shapes\". |\r\n| create_object | Create an object in the Maya scene. Object types available are cube, cone, sphere, cylinder, camera, spotLight, pointLight, directionalLight. |\r\n| get_object_attributes | Get a list of attributes on a Maya object. | \r\n| set_object_attributes | Set an object's attribute with a specific value. |\r\n| scene_new | Create a new scene in Maya. Use the force argument to force a new scene when an existing scene is loaded and has been modified. |\r\n| scene_open | Load in a scene into Maya. | \r\n| scene_save | Save the current scene. If the filename is not specified, it will save it as its current name. |\r\n| select_object | Select an object in the scene. |\r\n\r\n## Advanced Modeling Tools\r\n\r\n| Tool | Description |\r\n|------|-------------|\r\n| create_advanced_model | Create complex 3D models like cars, trees, buildings, cups, and chairs with detailed parameters. |\r\n| mesh_operations | Perform modeling operations such as extrude, bevel, subdivide, boolean, combine, bridge, and split. |\r\n| create_material | Create and assign materials with various types (lambert, phong, wood, marble, chrome, glass, etc.) |\r\n| create_curve | Generate NURBS curves for various shapes (line, circle, spiral, helix, star, gear, etc.) |\r\n| curve_modeling | Create geometry using curve-based modeling techniques (extrude, loft, revolve, sweep, etc.) |\r\n| organize_objects | Organize objects through grouping, parenting, layout, alignment, and distribution. |\r\n| generate_scene | Generate complete 3D scenes with multiple objects (city, forest, living room, office, park) |\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMaya MCP server is designed so there is only an MCP server and doesn't require anything to be installed within Maya. This is helpful since you can easily use different versions of Maya and not have to worry about coordinating version changes. This is done by taking advantage of the default Command Port Maya opens up for MEL scripting. \r\n\r\nMCP requires Python 3.10 or greater. Currently using pip as the package requirements are minimal. To install the virtual environment:\r\n\r\n1. download this project\r\n2. Create a virtual env using Python 3.10+ in the project directory. ```python -m venv .venv```\r\n3. activate the virtual environment\r\n   * Windows: ```.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat```\r\n   * Mac/Linux: ```source .venv\\bin\\activate.sh```\r\n4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```\r\n\r\nAs stated, there is nothing to install for Maya.\r\n\r\n### MCP Client Configuration\r\n\r\nDepending on which MCP Client you're using, the configuration file location differs. For [Anthopic Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), go to File -\u003e Settings -\u003e Developer Tab and press the Edit Config button. This will bring up the file finder in the directory location of the JSON config file.\r\n\r\nNext you need to edit the config JSON file by hand using a text editor.  Make sure to use full file paths.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"mcpServers\": {\r\n    \"MayaMCP\": {\r\n      \"command\": \"[FULL PATH TO MayaMCP PROJECT]/.venv/Scripts/python.exe\",\r\n      \"args\": [\r\n        \"[FULL PATH TO MayaMCP PROJECT]/src/maya_mcp_server.py\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the changes have been made, restart Claude Desktop (use Exit menu item instead of just closing the window). In the Developers Tab, you will now see the Maya MCP server listed.\r\n\r\nIn Claude Desktop, you can verify the Maya MCP tools are available. Press the  button and a detailed popup will appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Maya Communications\r\n\r\nWhen the Maya MCP server first attempts to communicate with Maya, you will get this popup within Maya. Please click \"Allow All\" to allow for ongoing communication between the MCP server and Maya. This will need to be done each Maya session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Developer Notes\r\n\r\nThe Maya MCP Server module was designed to be easily modified in a non-intrusive way. This is done by having the Maya Python code reside in the MCP server and sent to Maya's command port for execution. The results are sent back to the server and processed.\r\n\r\nThe default Maya command port runs MEL so the Python code is modified to run within MEL function call to the Python interpreter. There is also some limits such as multi-line Python code can't have any returned results. So, each command creates two connections to Maya. First to run the operation and save the results. The second connection then to read back the results. \r\n\r\nTo help minimize populating the namespace in the Maya global Python interpreter, functions and variables sent to Maya will be scoped to start with _mcp_maya_*. Each of the Maya tools are scoped into a function named _mcp_maya_scope(). The results are assigned to the variable _mcp_maya_results. This way should significantly reduce the possibility of name collisions. \r\n\r\nThere is a bit of elegance to this design. You basically can just add the Python file, restart the MCP Client and Maya MCP server and go. You don't need to integrate the operations on both the Maya MCP server and Maya itself. The code you add is only Maya specific Python and doesn't need to add any MCP decorators. This is a much better design to grow and adapt to different installations instead of having a fixed set of tools.\r\n\r\nThe Maya MCP server was built using the low-level Python MCP module. This was necessary to allow for dynamically defining all of the tools at run time. The tool function signatures are captured dynamically at the start of the server. \r\n\r\n### Adding New Tools\r\n\r\nIt is easy to add new tools to Maya MCP. You don't need to change any of the existing code. All you need to do is add a single tool command Python file to the mayatools/thirdparty directory. The tool itself will run in Maya so it will have access to all of the Maya Python modules. There are a few programmer notes in the design of the tool.\r\n\r\n* The name of the Python file and the function name must be the same. Make sure it is unique.\r\n* The Python function will be loaded by both the server and Maya. Any code outside of the function must be able to be loaded into standalone Python. Meaning any imports such as maya.cmds should be done in the scope of the function. The MCP server loads the function so it can inspect the function signature to send the information to MCP Client via JSON-RPC.\r\n* The function signature will be parsed and must include any types in the function argument annotation.\r\n* When your function is sent to Maya, it will be scoped within am _mcp_maya_scope function. This provides a number of benefits. The functions sent to Maya will not polute the Python global space too much running in Maya. Plus, any exceptions thrown will be caught and returned back to the MCP Client as errors.\r\n* Generally, you want to return either a list or dictionary or throw an exception when there is an error.\r\n* Name your function and arguments appropriately so the LLM can understand the operation. Include a function doc string.\r\n* Default arguments are good. \r\n* Error checking is good so error messages can provide better failed explanations.\r\n\r\nI recommend looking at the existing Maya tools in this project as examples.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nCurrently Maya MCP has only been tested on Windows. Should work on both Linux and Mac as everything is using standard Python.\r\n\r\n## Future Ideas\r\n\r\nIt's early days for MCP and there is a lot to improve. Here are some ideas.\r\n\r\n* Expose more functionality.\r\n* Improve using prompt engineering, particularly describing Maya's usage and data relationships.\r\n* Everything is registered as tools, allow for resources and prompts.\r\n* It could be possible to find any plugins within Maya that has MCP tools. Maybe something like looking at the PYTHONPATH within Maya with any directory named MCP. All of those could be inspected and then provided back to the MCP Client.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\r\n* [Anthopic Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)\r\n* [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)\r\n* [Unreal MCP](https://github.com/chongdashu/unreal-mcp)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important Note\r\n\r\nThis project was done on my personal time and equipment to learn about MCP.

Established users should follow the subsequent update procedure:\n- Download the newest iteration of `addon.py` and substitute the previous version, subsequently registering it within Blender.\n- Re-registering the MCP service within Claude (by removal and re-addition) often resolves minor connection glitches.\n\n## Core Functionality\n\n- **Bilateral Communication:** Establishes a persistent, socket-based link between the Claude inference engine and Blender.\n- **Geometric Manipulation:** Permits the AI to conceive, modify, and purge three-dimensional entities within the scene.\n- **Material Definition:** Enables control over surface properties, including color schemes and shader assignments.\n- **Scene Diagnostics:** Allows retrieval of granular data describing the current state of the Blender workspace.\n- **Script Execution:** Grants the ability to securely run arbitrary Python commands within the Blender environment directly from AI prompts.\n\n## Architectural Elements\n\nThe setup comprises two essential parts:\n\n1. **Blender Plugin (`addon.py`)**: This component resides inside Blender, initiating a listener socket to accept and process external instructions.\n2. **MCP Handler (`src/blender_mcp/server.py`)**: A standalone Python process that adheres to the MCP specification, managing the connection layer to the Blender plugin.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Blender software, version 3.0 or later.\n- Python runtime environment, version 3.10 or newer.\n- The 'uv' package manager utility:\n\n**For macOS Users:**\n```bash\nbrew install uv\n```\n**For Windows Users:**\n```bash\npowershell -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n``` \nFollowed by updating the system PATH:\n```bash\nset Path=C:\\Users\\nntra\\.local\\bin;%Path%\n```\nRefer to the official documentation for other operating systems: [Install uv Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)\n\n**Crucial Note: UV must be installed before proceeding.**\n\n### Environment Configuration Variables\n\nThe connection parameters can be customized via the following environment settings:\n\n- `BLENDER_HOST`: Specifies the network address for the Blender socket listener (Default: \"localhost\").\n- `BLENDER_PORT`: Defines the communication port (Default: 9876).\n\nExample of setting variables:\n```bash\nexport BLENDER_HOST='host.docker.internal'\nexport BLENDER_PORT=9876\n```\n\n### Integrating with Claude Desktop\n\n[Consult this video for setup guidance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neoK_WMq92g) (Assumes 'uv' is already configured).\n\nNavigate within Claude to Settings \u003e Developer \u003e Edit Config, and modify `claude_desktop_config.json` to include this server definition:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"blender\": {\n            \"command\": \"uvx\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"blender-mcp\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Cursor Editor Integration\n\n[![Install MCP Server via Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=blender\u0026config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoidXZ4IGJsZW5kZXItbWNwIn0%3D)\n\nMac users should navigate to Settings \u003e MCP and input the following configuration:\n- Use \"Add New Global MCP Server\" for system-wide access, or create/update `.cursor/mcp.json` in the project root for local scope.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"blender\": {\n            \"command\": \"uvx\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"blender-mcp\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWindows users should go to Settings \u003e MCP \u003e Add Server and configure it as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"blender\": {\n            \"command\": \"cmd\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"/c\",\n                \"uvx\",\n                \"blender-mcp\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n[Cursor Integration Walkthrough Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgWsJshecac)\n\n**Critical Warning: Only one MCP server instance (either Claude Desktop or Cursor) should be active concurrently.**\n\n### Visual Studio Code Integration\n\n_Prerequisite: Ensure Microsoft Visual Studio Code is installed._\n\n[![Install blender-mcp server in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_blender--mcp_server-0098FF?style=flat-square\u0026logo=visualstudiocode\u0026logoColor=ffffff)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22blender-mcp%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22blender-mcp%22%5D%7D)\n\n### Installing the Blender Plugin\n\n1. Retrieve the `addon.py` file from this repository.\n2. Launch Blender.\n3. Navigate to Edit \u003e Preferences \u003e Add-ons.\n4. Select the \"Install...\" button and locate the downloaded `addon.py`.\n5. Activate the addon by checking the box labeled \"Interface: Blender MCP\".\n\n## Operational Use\n\n### Establishing Connectivity\n\n1. Within Blender, access the 3D View sidebar (shortcut: 'N' key if hidden).\n2. Locate and select the \"BlenderMCP\" panel.\n3. Optionally, activate the Poly Haven integration checkbox if external assets are desired.\n4. Initiate the connection process by clicking \"Connect to Claude\".\n5. Verify that the MCP server process is active and running in your command-line interface.\n\n### Interacting with Claude\n\nOnce the configuration is registered in Claude and the Blender plugin is listening, a specialized tool icon (resembling a hammer) will appear, signifying the Blender MCP interface.\n\n#### Supported Actions\n\n- Querying details about the active scene and its constituent objects.\n- Programmatic generation, removal, and modification of geometric primitives.\n- Assigning or developing new material definitions for objects.\n- Executing arbitrary Python scripts within the Blender context via AI command.\n- Programmatic retrieval of appropriate models, textures, and HDRIs from the [Poly Haven repository](https://polyhaven.com/).\n- Leveraging [Hyper3D Rodin](https://hyper3d.ai/) for AI-synthesized 3D geometry.\n\n### Command Illustrations\n\nExamples of AI directives:\n\n- \"Construct a cavernous dungeon environment featuring a dragon protecting a hoard of gold.\" [Visual Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqgKuLYUv00)\n- \"Compose a coastal ambiance utilizing HDRIs, surface textures, and corresponding models (e.g., stones, flora) sourced from Poly Haven.\" [Visual Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I29rn92gkC4)\n- \"Generate a complete Blender scene based on this provided reference image.\" [Visual Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDRb03XPiRo)\n- \"Synthesize a rendering of a garden gnome using the Hyper3D generation service.\"\n- \"Report on the current scene metrics, subsequently generating a Three.js compatible sketch of the setup.\" [Visual Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxbNI5L7AH8)\n- \"Change the color scheme of this object to a reflective red metallic finish.\"\n- \"Instantiate a spherical primitive and position it directly above the existing cuboid object.\"\n- \"Set the scene illumination to mimic professional studio lighting conditions.\"\n- \"Orient the camera view towards the center of the composition and switch the perspective to orthographic.\"\n\n## Hyper3D Service Notes\n\nHyper3D's introductory tier limits daily asset generation. Exceeding this quota necessitates waiting for the daily reset or acquiring a personalized key via hyper3d.ai or fal.ai.\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n- **Connectivity Failures:** Verify the Blender plugin server is active and the MCP configuration is correct in Claude. **Do not execute the `uvx` command in the terminal** if running through the IDE integration. Initial commands may fail; subsequent attempts usually succeed.\n- **Request Timeouts:** Consider breaking complex instructions into sequential, smaller operations or streamlining the prompt content.\n- **Poly Haven Errors:** Claude's interaction with external APIs can occasionally be inconsistent.\n- **The Classic Reboot:** If connection persistence remains an issue, restart both the Claude application and the dedicated Blender MCP listener.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\n### Data Exchange Protocol\n\nThe communication layer relies on TCP sockets transmitting standardized JSON payloads:\n\n- **Outgoing Data (Commands):** JSON structures containing a mandatory `type` field and optional `params` payload.\n- **Incoming Data (Responses):** JSON structures indicating `status` alongside either a `result` payload or an error `message`.\n\n## Constraints \u0026 Security Postures\n\n- The `execute_blender_code` utility permits the execution of any Python script within Blender's context. This presents considerable capability but demands prudence, especially in live operational systems. **Always commit or save your project state prior to invoking this function.**\n- Poly Haven downloads external assets (textures, geometry, HDRIs). This feature can be disabled via its dedicated checkbox in the Blender UI if unwanted.\n- Intricate modeling tasks might require decomposition into discrete, manageable steps for optimal AI performance.\n\n## Contributions Policy\n\nWe welcome external input! Please submit any proposed enhancements as a Pull Request.\n\n## Project Attribution\n\nThis extension is a community effort, independent of the official Blender foundation.

Returns an vj:// URI to reference the Video file\n- create-videojungle-project\n  - Creates a Video Jungle project to contain generative scripts, analyzed videos, and images for video edit generation\n- edit-locally\n  - Creates an OpenTimelineIO project and downloads it to your machine to open in a Davinci Resolve Studio instance (Resolve Studio _must_ already be running before calling this tool.) \n- generate-edit-from-videos\n  - Generates a rendered video edit from a set of video files\n- generate-edit-from-single-video\n  - Generate an edit from a single input video file\n- get-project-assets\n  - Get assets within a project for video edit generation.\n- search-videos\n  - Returns video matches based upon embeddings and keywords\n- update-video-edit\n  - Live update a video edit's information. If Video Jungle is open, edit will be updated in real time.\n\n### Using Tools in Practice\n\nIn order to use the tools, you'll need to sign up for Video Jungle and add your API key.\n\n**add-video**\n\nHere's an example prompt to invoke the `add-video` tool:\n\n```\ncan you download the video at https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RumgYaH5XYw and name it fly traps?\n```\n\nThis will download a video from a URL, add it to your library, and analyze it for retrieval later. Analysis is multi-modal, so both audio and visual components can be queried against.\n\n**search-videos**\n\nOnce you've got a video downloaded and analyzed, you can then do queries on it using the `search-videos` tool:\n\n```\ncan you search my videos for fly traps?\n```\n\nSearch results contain relevant metadata for generating a video edit according to details discovered in the initial analysis.\n\n**search-local-videos**\n\nYou must set the environment variable `LOAD_PHOTOS_DB=1` in order to use this tool, as it will make Claude prompt to access your files on your local machine.\n\nOnce that's done, you can search through your Photos app for videos that exist on your phone, using Apple's tags.\n\nIn my case, when I search for \"Skateboard\", I get 1903 video files.\n\n```\ncan you search my local video files for Skateboard?\n```\n\n**generate-edit-from-videos**\n\nFinally, you can use these search results to generate an edit:\n\n```\ncan you create an edit of all the times the video says \"fly trap\"?\n```\n\n(Currently), the video edits tool relies on the context within the current chat. \n\n**generate-edit-from-single-video**\n\nFinally, you can cut down an edit from a single, existing video:\n\n```\ncan you create an edit of all the times this video says the word \"fly trap\"?\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou must login to [Video Jungle settings](https://app.video-jungle.com/profile/settings), and get your [API key](https://app.video-jungle.com/profile/settings). Then, use this to start Video Jungle MCP:\n\n```bash\n$ uv run video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\n```\n\nTo allow this MCP server to search your Photos app on MacOS:\n\n```\n$ LOAD_PHOTOS_DB=1 uv run video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\n```\n## Quickstart\n\n### Install\n\n#### Installing via Smithery\n\nTo install Video Editor for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/video-editor-mcp):\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install video-editor-mcp --client claude\n```\n\n#### Claude Desktop\n\nYou'll need to adjust your `claude_desktop_config.json` manually:\n\nOn MacOS: `~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\nOn Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n  \u003csummary\u003ePublished Server Configuration\u003c/summary\u003e\n  \n ```json\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"video-editor-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\n        \"YOURAPIKEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\u003c/details\u003e\n  \u003csummary\u003eDevelopment/Unpublished Servers Configuration\u003c/summary\u003e\n  \n ```json\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"video-editor-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"/Users/YOURDIRECTORY/video-editor-mcp\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\n        \"YOURAPIKEY\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  With local Photos app access enabled (search your Photos app):\n\n  ```json\n    \"video-jungle-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"/Users/\u003cPATH_TO\u003e/video-jungle-mcp\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"video-editor-mcp\",\n        \"\u003cYOURAPIKEY\u003e\"\n      ],\n     \"env\": {\n\t      \"LOAD_PHOTOS_DB\": \"1\"\n      }\n    },\n  ```\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nBe sure to replace the directories with the directories you've placed the repository in on **your** computer.\n\n## Development\n\n### Building and Publishing\n\nTo prepare the package for distribution:\n\n1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:\n```bash\nuv sync\n```\n\n2. Build package distributions:\n```bash\nuv build\n```\n\nThis will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.\n\n3. Publish to PyPI:\n```bash\nuv publish\n```\n\nNote: You'll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:\n- Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`\n- Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`\n\n### MCP Server Registry\n\n```\nmcp-name: io.github.burningion/video-editing-mcp\n```\n\n### Debugging\n\nSince MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging\nexperience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).\n\n\nYou can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:\n\n(Be sure to replace `YOURDIRECTORY` and `YOURAPIKEY` with the directory this repo is in, and your Video Jungle API key, found in the settings page.)\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run --directory /Users/YOURDIRECTORY/video-editor-mcp video-editor-mcp YOURAPIKEY\n```\n\n\nUpon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.\n\nAdditionally, I've added logging to `app.log` in the project directory. You can add logging to diagnose API calls via a:\n\n```\nlogging.info(\"this is a test log\")\n```\n\nA reasonable way to follow along as you're workin on the project is to open a terminal session and do a:\n\n```bash\n$ tail -n 90 -f app.log\n```",

Subsequently, proceed directly to the [Client Integration Section](#claude-desktop-configuration) and utilize the `NPX` deployment strategy outlined there.\n\n## Navigational Index\n\n- [Attributions](#acknowledgements)\n- [Exposed Functionality](#available-tools)\n- [Operational Constraints](#caveats)\n- [System Requirements](#prerequisites)\n- [Installation Procedure](#setup)\n- [Local Execution Guide](#running-the-server-locally)\n  - [Method A: Source Code Development](#option-1-local-development)\n  - [Method B: Containerization](#option-2-docker)\n- [Validation Interface](#inspection)\n- [Client Compatibility](#mcp-clients)\n  - [Claude Desktop Integration](#claude-desktop-configuration)\n    - [NPX Launch](#npx)\n    - [Local Runtime Node](#local-node)\n    - [Containerized Deployment](#docker)\n  - [LibreChat Adapter](#librechat)\n  - [LM Studio Hookup](#lm-studio)\n- [Future Development Log](#todo)\n- [Licensing Terms](#license)\n\n## Attributions\n\nThis architecture is constructed leveraging [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp), a framework implemented in TypeScript designed specifically for constructing robust MCP services. Refer to the [FastMCP documentation](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp/blob/main/README.md) or the [official MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for deeper insights into MCP concepts and service utilization.\n\n## Exposed Functionality\n\nReview the complete roster of accessible operations here: [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)\n\n## Operational Constraints\n\n- The official [Discogs API documentation](https://www.discogs.com/developers) may exhibit incompleteness or occasional structural deviations across various endpoints.\n- Given the sheer breadth of the Discogs API schema, comprehensive type verification across all potential return structures is impractical. Users are encouraged to report any observed type mismatches.\n- This MCP service permits modification of user-owned Discogs data. Exercise prudence and confirm all intended write operations prior to execution.\n- The Discogs API defaults to retrieving 50 items per request (`per_page`). To mitigate potential processing strain on certain consuming clients, this service enforces a lower default limit of `5` items via `discogs.config.defaultPerPage`. While larger retrievals can be requested via prompt instructions, client stability may be impacted.\n\n## System Requirements\n\n- A functional installation of Node.js (verified compatible with Node.js `20.x.x`; `18.x.x` is generally acceptable).\n  - Verify your installation with: `node --version`\n- Docker (Optional; provides a dependency-free execution environment).\n\n## Installation Procedure\n\n1. Obtain a copy of the source repository via cloning.\n2. Generate a configuration file named `.env` in the root directory, basing it on the provided `.env.example` template.\n3. Populate the necessary credentials within the `.env` file:\n   - `DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your unique authentication key issued by Discogs.\n\nTo acquire your necessary token, navigate to your [Discogs Settings \u003e Developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers) interface to retrieve an existing token or generate a new credential. **CRITICAL: This token must remain confidential.** Future updates will incorporate OAuth support.\n\nThe remaining parameters detailed in `.env.example` utilize safe default values and only require explicit definition if non-standard configurations are necessary.\n\n## Local Execution Guide\n\n### Method A: Source Code Development\n\n1. Install requisite dependencies:\n   bash\n   pnpm install\n   \n\n2. Available invocation commands:\n   - `pnpm run dev`: Initiates the development server with live code reloading enabled.\n   - `pnpm run dev:stream`: Activates the development server supporting HTTP streaming functionality with hot reloading.\n   - `pnpm run build`: Compiles the production-ready artifact.\n   - `pnpm run start`: Executes the compiled production version.\n   - `pnpm run inspect`: Launches the integrated MCP Inspector utility (refer to [Validation Interface](#inspection)).\n   - `pnpm run format`: Validates adherence to code style conventions (utilizing Prettier).\n   - `pnpm run lint`: Executes static code analysis (utilizing ESLint).\n   - `pnpm run test`: Runs unit tests via Vitest.\n   - `pnpm run test:coverage`: Generates test execution reports using Vitest v8.\n   - `pnpm run version:check`: Confirms consistency between `package.json` versioning and `src/version.ts` content.\n\n### Method B: Containerization\n\n1. Construct the Docker container image:\n   bash\n   docker build -t discogs-mcp-server:latest .\n   \n\n2. Initiate the container runtime:\n   bash\n   docker run --env-file .env discogs-mcp-server:latest\n   \n\n   For activating the HTTP Streaming transport mode:\n   bash\n   # Ensure the mapped port aligns with the setting in your .env file\n   docker run --env-file .env -p 3001:3001 discogs-mcp-server:latest stream\n   \n\n## Validation Interface\n\nInvoke the MCP Inspector tool to evaluate the responsiveness of your locally hosted MCP service:\n\nbash\npnpm run inspect\n\n\nAccess the inspector interface at `http://127.0.0.1:6274` in your web browser for interactive testing.\n\nFor comprehensive details on the Inspector utility, consult [the official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).\n\n## Client Compatibility\n\nAdditional integration examples will be appended subsequently. If configuration details for a specific client platform are immediately required, please either file a feature request via a new issue or submit a direct contribution by editing this section of the documentation.\n\n### Claude Desktop Integration\n\nLocate your configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`) via `Claude \u003e Settings \u003e Developer \u003e Edit Config`. Integrate **only one** of the subsequent configuration blocks based on your preferred operational method:\n\n#### NPX Launch\n\nDirect execution sourced from the npm registry.\n\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"discogs\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"discogs-mcp-server\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"\u003cYOUR_TOKEN\u003e\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n#### Local Runtime Node\n\nPrerequisite: Dependencies must be fully resolved beforehand (`pnpm install`).\n\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"discogs\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"tsx\",\n        \"/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/src/index.ts\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"\u003cYOUR_TOKEN\u003e\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n#### Containerized Deployment\n\nPrerequisite: The Docker image must be successfully built prior to utilization.\n\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"discogs\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--env-file\",\n        \"/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/.env\",\n        \"discogs-mcp-server:latest\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nClient-side modifications to local code necessitate a restart of the Claude application for effect. Furthermore, Claude imposes a mandatory human approval step before executing any MCP tool invocation, typically only required once per tool across a single conversation session. _Note: Users of the complimentary service tier may experience escalated tool execution failure rates in prolonged chat sessions due to context window limitations._\n\n### LibreChat Adapter\n\nWithin the `librechat.yaml` configuration file, append the following entry under the `mcpServers` hierarchy:\n\nyaml\ndiscogs:\n  type: stdio\n  command: npx\n  args: [\"-y\", \"discogs-mcp-server\"]\n  env:\n    DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE\n\n\n### LM Studio Hookup\n\nNavigate to the Chat `Settings` interface. In the `Program` tab, switch the dropdown menu from its default (`Install`) to `Edit mcp.json`. Inject the following JSON object into the `mcpServers` section:\n\n\n\"discogs\": {\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"discogs-mcp-server\"\n  ],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nAfter persistence via the Save button, an activation toggle labeled `mcp/discogs` should appear in the `Program` tab. Additionally, within every active chat interface, the `Integrations` menu permits per-chat enablement of MCP services.\n\n## Future Development Log\n\n- Implementation of OAuth 2.0 authentication flows.\n- Integration of missing endpoint functionalities, specifically:\n  - Batch uploading/management of collection inventory.\n\n## Licensing Terms\n\nThis service is distributed under the terms of the MIT License.

      "readme_content": "# Textual Access Nexus for the Holy Scripture Corpus\n\nThis Model Context Protocol (MCP) engine is engineered to interface precisely with the Quran.com data repository, leveraging its formal [REST API specification, version 4](https://api-docs.quran.com/docs/content_apis_versioned/4.0.0/content-apis).\n\n## High-Level Summary\n\nThis utility acts as an abstraction layer, translating LLM directives into structured calls against the OpenAPI document that defines the Quran.com content service. It exposes curated endpoints as discrete, actionable tools for compatible client applications.\n\n## Available Functional Interfaces (Endpoints)\n\nThe following capabilities, derived directly from the underlying API, are exposed for algorithmic utilization:\n\n### Scriptural Divisions (Chapters/Surahs)\n* Fetching a complete roster of all divisions (`GET /chapters`)\n* Retrieving specific data for an identified division (`GET /chapters/{id}`)\n* Obtaining supplementary metadata for a given chapter (`GET /chapters/{chapter_id}/info`)\n\n### Individual Passages (Verses)\n* Querying passages based on their primary division number (`GET /verses/by_chapter/{chapter_number}`)\n* Locating verses corresponding to a specific page in the Madani print standard (`GET /verses/by_page/{page_number}`)\n* Retrieving verses segmented by the traditional thirty Juz parts (`GET /verses/by_juz/{juz_number}`)\n* Accessing verses grouped by Hizb markers (`GET /verses/by_hizb/{hizb_number}`)\n* Fetching passages delimited by the Rub el Hizb sections (`GET /verses/by_rub/{rub_el_hizb_number}`)\n* Resolving a passage using its unique identifier key (`GET /verses/by_key/{verse_key}`)\n* Requesting a randomly selected passage (`GET /verses/random`)\n\n### Juz Segmentation Index\n* Listing all thirty Juz divisions (`GET /juzs`)\n\n### Content Search Mechanism\n* Executing keyword searches across the Quranic text base (`GET /search`)\n\n### Interpretive and Linguistic Resources (Translations)\n* Obtaining a directory of available translated texts (`GET /resources/translations`)\n* Fetching metadata for a selected translation variant (`GET /resources/translations/{translation_id}/info`)\n\n### Scholarly Commentaries (Tafsirs)\n* Retrieving the catalog of available exegeses (`GET /resources/tafsirs`)\n* Fetching descriptive metadata for a specified exegesis (`GET /resources/tafsirs/{tafsir_id}/info`)\n* Retrieving the full text of a single commentary entry (`GET /quran/tafsirs/{tafsir_id}`)\n\n### Recitation Assets (Audio)\n* Listing available reciters for chapter audio playback (`GET /resources/chapter_reciters`)\n* Identifying supported modes of recitation (`GET /resources/recitation_styles`)\n\n### Lexical Support\n* Retrieving the list of supported human languages (`GET /resources/languages`)\n\n## Deployment Protocols\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Execution environment must feature Node.js version 22 or newer.\n* Docker utility is required for containerized deployment.\n\n### Container Image Construction\n\nTo ready the service for execution within a Docker context, execute the following command to build the necessary artifact:\n\nbash\n# Construct the Docker artifact\ndocker build -t quran-mcp-server .\n\n\n## Integration into Claude Desktop Interface\n\nTo enable interaction with this textual utility via Claude Desktop, integrate the corresponding configuration block into your `claude_desktop_config.json` file (location varies by OS, e.g., `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/...` on macOS):\n\n### Containerized Production Setup\n\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"quran-api\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\"run\", \"-i\", \"--rm\", \"--init\", \"-e\", \"API_KEY=your_api_key_if_needed\", \"-e\", \"VERBOSE_MODE=true\", \"quran-mcp-server\"],\n      \"disabled\": false,\n      \"autoApprove\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n### Direct Node.js Production Runtime\n\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"quran-api\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/quran-mcp-server/dist/src/server.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"API_KEY\": \"your_api_key_if_needed\",\n        \"VERBOSE_MODE\": \"true\"\n      },\n      \"disabled\": false,\n      \"autoApprove\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n### Active Development Mode (Source Files)\n\n\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"quran-api\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"ts-node\", \"/path/to/quran-mcp-server/src/server.ts\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"API_KEY\": \"your_api_key_if_needed\",\n        \"VERBOSE_MODE\": \"true\"\n      },\n      \"disabled\": false,\n      \"autoApprove\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n**Critical Implementation Directives:**\n- Substitute `/path/to/quran-mcp-server` with the definitive directory path on your local filesystem.\n- Ensure prerequisite compilation (`npm run build` or the `docker build` command) is executed prior to utilizing production configurations.\n- Update `your_api_key_if_needed` with valid credentials if the Quran.com service mandates authorization.\n- Configuration merging: Append this server definition to any existing entries within the `mcpServers` object.\n- A full relaunch of the Claude Desktop application is required for configuration updates to become active.\n\n## Operational Parameters (Environment Variables)\n\n* `API_KEY`: Credential required for authenticated access to the upstream API.\n* `PORT`: The network conduit the server listens on (defaults are typically 8000 or 3000 depending on the runtime environment).\n* `VERBOSE_MODE`: Setting this to 'true' activates extensive logging of all inbound requests and outbound responses (default status is 'false').\n\n## Diagnostic Logging (Verbose Mode)\n\nWhen `VERBOSE_MODE` is activated, the service outputs comprehensive diagnostic data, invaluable for troubleshooting and monitoring API transactional integrity. The logging structure incorporates a precise timestamp and a log classification prefix (REQUEST, RESPONSE, or ERROR) for clear traceability:\n\n* **Inbound Requests**: Logs the invocation name of the tool and its associated input parameters.\n* **Outbound Responses**: Records the tool name that was executed and the resultant data payload.\n* **Fault Reporting**: Captures detailed error context, including exception class, descriptive message, and stack trace information where available.\n\n## Verification Suite\n\nbash\n# Initiate the automated test suite\nnpm test\n\n\n## Project Endowment License\n\nThis software utility is released under the terms of the MIT License.\n\nCULTURAL_CONTEXT_NOTE: The concept of popular culture (often contrasted with 'high culture' or 'folk culture') describes the prevailing, widely disseminated collection of beliefs, artistic creations, and societal practices dominant within a contemporary milieu. Historically, mass media and capitalist imperatives have fueled its expansion, influencing everyday perceptions. This tool, conversely, deals with a singular, foundational religious text, often regarded as immutable or possessing a cultural status distinct from the transient nature of typical popular output.",

It allows AI clients to access movie, TV show, and person data through a standardized protocol.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Search Movies**: Perform multi-search across movies, TV shows, and people using the `search_tmdb` tool.\n- **Get Details**: Fetch detailed information for specific items using the `get_tmdb_details` tool.\n- **Trending Content**: Retrieve trending content across all media types with the `trending_all` tool.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js version 18 or higher (required for global fetch support)\n- A TMDB API key (Bearer token) from your admin, used with the TNL TMDB proxy (production-api.tnl.one)\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Set up your TMDB API key as an environment variable:\n\n   - On Windows PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     $env:TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN=\"YOUR_TNL_PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN\"\n     ```\n\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n     ```bash\n     export TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN=\"YOUR_TNL_PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN\"\n     ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Starting the MCP Server\n\nTo start the server:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nThe server communicates over stdio and should be configured in your MCP-compatible client (e.g., IDE or chat client) with the command `node mcp-tmdb-server.js` and the `TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.\n\n### MCP Integration Examples\n\nHere are code snippets showing how to integrate with the MCP tools:\n\n#### Search for Movies\n\n```javascript\n// Example MCP tool call for searching\n{\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"search_tmdb\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"query\": \"dune\",\n      \"page\": 1,\n      \"language\": \"en-US\",\n      \"include_adult\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Get Movie Details\n\n```javascript\n// Example MCP tool call for getting details\n{\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"get_tmdb_details\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"type\": \"movie\",\n      \"id\": 438631,\n      \"append\": \"credits,images\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Get Trending Content\n\n```javascript\n// Example MCP tool call for trending content\n{\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"trending_all\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"time_window\": \"day\",\n      \"page\": 1,\n      \"language\": \"en-US\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## MCP Client Integration\n\nPer integrare questo MCP server nel tuo client MCP (come un IDE o un client di chat compatibile), segui questi passi:\n\n1. Installa il pacchetto npm se necessario:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g wizzy-mcp-tmdb\n   ```\n\n2. Crea o aggiorna il file `mcp.json` nel tuo client MCP con la seguente configurazione:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"tmdb\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"wizzy-mcp-tmdb\"],\n         \"env\": {\n           \"TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN\": \"YOUR_TNL_PROXY_BEARER_TOKEN\"\n         },\n         \"alwaysAllow\": [\n           \"get_watch_providers\",\n           \"discover_tv\",\n           \"discover_by_provider\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Nota: Il `TMDB_AUTH_TOKEN` può essere impostato a un valore casuale per ora, poiché le chiamate API TMDB sono gratuite e non richiedono autenticazione obbligatoria.\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\nThe project uses Jest for comprehensive testing, including:\n\n- **Unit Tests**: Validate individual handler functions, input validation, and response formatting (see `tests/unit/handlers.test.js`).\n- **Integration Tests**: Test API interactions with mocked responses, error handling, and network failures (see `tests/integration/api.test.js`).\n- **Protocol Tests**: Ensure MCP protocol compliance, including tool listing and calling (see `tests/protocol/mcp.test.js`).\n\nRun the test suite with:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nFor watch mode:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test:watch\n```\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nwizzy-mcp-tmdb/\n├── mcp-tmdb-server.js          # Main MCP server implementation\n├── package.json                # Project configuration and dependencies\n├── MCP_GUIDE.md                # Detailed MCP integration guide\n├── babel.config.cjs            # Babel configuration for Jest\n├── tests/\n│   ├── unit/\n│   │   └── handlers.test.js    # Unit tests for handlers\n│   ├── integration/\n│   │   └── api.test.js         # Integration tests for API calls\n│   └── protocol/\n│       └── mcp.test.js         # MCP protocol compliance tests\n└── tests/fixtures/             # Mock data for tests\n    ├── movieDetails.json\n    ├── searchMultiResponse.json\n    └── trendingAllResponse.json\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!

It also encompasses the affective and interactive outcomes resulting from engagement with these dominant elements. In Western contexts, mass media, commercial promotion, and the demands of mass marketability, which philosopher Theodor Adorno critically labeled the 'culture industry,' drive its primary mechanisms. Heavily mediated in contemporary eras, this cultural aggregate significantly shapes individual outlooks on various subjects, yet its definition remains contested and context-dependent, frequently positioned against constructs like folk culture, high culture, or working-class culture, and analyzed through lenses such as structuralism or psychoanalysis. Core categories usually include entertainment (film, music, gaming), athletics, current affairs, sartorial trends, technology, and vernacular speech.*\n\n== Historical Perspective ==\n\nHistorically, folk traditions served a role parallel to what modern mass culture fulfills. The term \"popular culture\" predates or originates around the nineteenth century. Traditionally, it was often associated with lower socioeconomic strata and lesser formal education, standing opposed to the \"official culture\" of elites. The nineteenth-century Industrial Revolution spurred societal shifts, including rising literacy. Capitalist expansion fueled increased spending on accessible amusements (like commercialized public houses and organized sports). Reading materials proliferated; for instance, Victorian-era penny dreadfuls have been likened to modern video games—Britain's inaugural mass-produced popular literature for youth, as noted by The Guardian in 2016. Expanding consumerism and the advent of rail transport (the Stockton and Darlington Railway opened in 1825) simultaneously established both a market and a distribution network for inexpensive serial fiction, with the first penny issues appearing in the 1830s. The differentiation between pop culture and \"official culture\" sharpened toward the close of the 19th century, becoming firmly established by the interwar years.",

These tools enable you to control and manipulate NVIDIA Isaac Sim with simple commands:\n\n### Connection and Scene Management\n\n- **get_scene_info** - Pings the Isaac Sim Extension Server to verify connection status and retrieve basic scene information. Always use this first to ensure the connection is active.\n\n### Physics and Environment Creation\n\n- **create_physics_scene** - Creates a physics scene with configurable parameters:\n  - `objects`: List of objects to create (each with type and position)\n  - `floor`: Whether to create a ground plane (default: true)\n  - `gravity`: Vector defining gravity direction and magnitude (default: [0, -0.981, 0])\n  - `scene_name`: Name for the scene (default: \"physics_scene\")\n\n### Robot Creation and Control\n\n- **create_robot** - Creates a robot in the scene at a specified position:\n  - `robot_type`: Type of robot to create (options: \"franka\", \"jetbot\", \"carter\", \"g1\", \"go1\")\n  - `position`: [x, y, z] position coordinates\n\n### Omniverse Kit and Scripting\n\n- **omni_kit_command** - Executes an Omni Kit command:\n  - `command`: The Omni Kit command to execute (e.g., \"CreatePrim\")\n  - `prim_type`: The primitive type for the command (e.g., \"Sphere\")\n\n- **execute_script** - Executes arbitrary Python code in Isaac Sim:\n  - `code`: Python code to execute\n\n### Usage Best Practices\n\n1. Always check connection with `get_scene_info` before executing any commands\n2. Initialize a physics scene with `create_physics_scene` before adding robots\n3. Use `create_robot` for standard robot placement before trying custom scripts\n4. For complex simulations, use `execute_script` with proper async patterns\n5. Preview code in chat before execution for verification\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

It also encompasses the affective and experiential responses generated through engagement with these dominant cultural artifacts. The mechanisms of mass communication, commercial promotion, and the capitalist drive for broad accessibility are the principal drivers of Western popular culture, a construct critiqued by Theodor Adorno as the 'culture industry.' This body of circulating ideas, heavily influenced by contemporary media forms, pervades quotidian life, thereby shaping individual perspectives on numerous subjects. Due to varied definitional approaches across distinct contexts and academic schools (e.g., psychoanalysis, structuralism, postmodernism), pop culture lacks a singular, universally accepted demarcation, typically being differentiated from folk culture, working-class culture, or high culture. Standard categorical inclusions are: entertainment (cinema, music, televised content, digitized literature, interactive gaming), athletics, current affairs, sociopolitical discourse, sartorial trends, digital technology, and vernacular language.\n\n== Historical Development ==\n\nHistorically, the role now filled by popular culture was occupied by localized folk traditions within specific communities or nations.\nThe term \"popular culture\" surfaced in or before the nineteenth century. Initially, it was frequently correlated with lower educational attainment and the working strata, standing in opposition to the 'official culture' and elevated scholarship of the elite classes.\nThe advent of the Industrial Revolution (eighteenth and nineteenth centuries) spurred profound societal shifts in Britain, leading to increased literacy. Simultaneously, the growth of industrial capitalism expanded discretionary spending on leisure activities, such as commercial public houses and organized sports. Reading also gained prominence. In 2016, The Guardian likened cheap serial fiction, termed \"penny dreadfuls,\" to the Victorian era's progenitor of digital gaming, representing \"Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.\" The emergent consumerism, coupled with novel transportation methods like the railway (the Stockton and Darlington Railway opened in 1825), cultivated both a demand for inexpensive popular literature and the logistical capability for widespread dissemination. The first serialized penny publications appeared in the 1830s to satisfy this mounting demand.\nThe demarcation separating this culture from 'official culture' became more pronounced near the century's close, a distinction solidifying during the interwar period.",

The code is structured with clear sections for different areas of functionality.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- Blackmagic Design for DaVinci Resolve and its API\n- The MCP protocol team for enabling AI assistant integration\n\n## Project Structure\n\nAfter cleanup, the project has the following structure:\n\n- `resolve_mcp_server.py` - The main MCP server implementation\n- `run-now.sh` - Quick start script that handles setup and runs the server\n- `setup.sh` - Complete setup script for installation\n- `check-resolve-ready.sh` - Pre-launch check to verify DaVinci Resolve is ready\n- `start-server.sh` - Script to start the server\n- `run-server.sh` - Simplified script to run the server directly\n\n**Key Directories:**\n- `src/` - Source code and modules\n- `assets/` - Project assets and resources\n- `logs/` - Log files directory\n- `scripts/` - Helper scripts\n\nWhen developing, it's recommended to use `./run-now.sh` which sets up the environment and launches the server in one step. \n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [docs/CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes. \n\n### Cursor-Specific Setup\n\nWhen integrating with Cursor, follow these specific steps:\n\n1. Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting Cursor\n\n2. Install required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   # From the davinci-resolve-mcp directory:\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n   Note: This will install the MCP package and other dependencies automatically.\n\n3. Set up the MCP server configuration in Cursor:\n   \n   Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` on macOS (or `%USERPROFILE%\\.cursor\\mcp.json` on Windows):\n   \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"davinci-resolve\": {\n         \"name\": \"DaVinci Resolve MCP\",\n         \"command\": \"/path/to/your/venv/bin/python\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"/path/to/your/davinci-resolve-mcp/src/main.py\"\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   **Important Notes:**\n   - Use `main.py` as the entry point (not `resolve_mcp_server.py`)\n   - Use absolute paths in the configuration\n\n4. Common issues:\n   - \"Client closed\" error: Check that paths are correct in mcp.json and dependencies are installed\n   - Connection problems: Make sure DaVinci Resolve is running before starting Cursor\n   - Environment variables: The main.py script will handle setting environment variables",

      "readme_content": "# AniList MCP Server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that interfaces with the AniList API, allowing LLM clients to access and interact with anime, manga, character, staff, and user data from AniList.\n\n## Features\n\n- Search for anime, manga, characters, staff, and studios\n- Get detailed information about specific anime, manga, characters, and staff members\n- Access user profiles and lists\n- Support for advanced filtering options\n- Retrieve genres and media tags\n- **Dual transport support**: Both HTTP and STDIO transports\n- **Cloud deployment ready**: Support Smithery and other platforms\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node.js 18+\n\n## Local Installation (STDIO Transport)\n\n1. Add this server to your `mcp.json` / `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"anilist\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"anilist-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"ANILIST_TOKEN\": \"your_api_token\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou may remove the `env` object entirely, if you are not planning to use the AniList Token for operations that require login.\n\n2. Restart your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop)\n3. Use the tools to interact with AniList\n\n## Server Deployment (HTTP Transport)\n\n### Self-Hosting\nFollow the [Local Development](#local-development) instructions to set up the project locally, then run:\n```bash\npnpm run start:http\n```\nThis will start the server on port 8081 by default. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.\n\n### Cloud Deployment\n\nYou can deploy this MCP server to any cloud platform that supports Node.js server applications.\n\nYou can also deploy via MCP platforms like [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@yuna0x0/anilist-mcp).\n\n## Configuration\n### Environment Variables (STDIO Transport and HTTP Transport server where host provides the config)\n\nWhen using the STDIO transport or hosting the HTTP transport server, you can pass configuration via environment variables:\n- `ANILIST_TOKEN`: (Optional) AniList API Token (Only needed for operations that require login)\n\n\u003e [!CAUTION]\n\u003e If you are hosting the HTTP transport server with token pre-configured, you should protect your endpoint and implement authentication before allowing users to access it. Otherwise, anyone can access your MCP server while using your AniList token.\n\n### HTTP Headers (HTTP Transport where user provides the config)\n\nWhen using the HTTP transport, user can pass configuration via HTTP headers:\n- `Anilist-Token`: (Optional) AniList API Token (Only needed for operations that require login)\n\nIf the user provides the token in the header, while the server also has `ANILIST_TOKEN` set, the header value will take precedence.\n\n### Get an AniList API Token (Optional)\n\nTo get an API token, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to [AniList settings](https://anilist.co/settings/developer).\n2. Click on \"Create New Client\".\n3. Use this URL as your client's \"Redirect URL\":\n```\nhttps://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin\n```\n\n4. Click \"Save\"\n5. Then go to https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/authorize?client_id={clientID}\u0026response_type=token, replace the `{clientID}` with the client ID you get. It will ask you to log in and then provide you with the token to use.\n6. Copy the generated token and use it in your `.env` file or environment variables.\n\n## Available Tools\n\n### Misc Tools\n- **get_genres**: Get all available genres on AniList\n- **get_media_tags**: Get all available media tags on AniList\n- **get_site_statistics**: Get AniList site statistics over the last seven days\n- **get_studio**: Get information about a studio by its AniList ID or name\n- **favourite_studio**: [Requires Login] Favourite or unfavourite a studio by its ID\n\n### Activity Tools\n- **delete_activity**: [Requires Login] Delete the current authorized user's activity post\n- **get_activity**: Get a specific AniList activity by its ID\n- **get_user_activity**: Fetch activities from a user\n- **post_message_activity**: [Requires Login] Post a new message activity or update an existing one\n- **post_text_activity**: [Requires Login] Post a new text activity or update an existing one\n\n### List Tools\n- **get_user_anime_list**: Get a user's anime list\n- **get_user_manga_list**: Get a user's manga list\n- **add_list_entry**: [Requires Login] Add an entry to the authorized user's list\n- **remove_list_entry**: [Requires Login] Remove an entry from the authorized user's list\n- **update_list_entry**: [Requires Login] Update an entry on the authorized user's list\n\n### Media Tools\n- **get_anime**: Get detailed information about an anime by its AniList ID\n- **get_manga**: Get detailed information about a manga by its AniList ID\n- **favourite_anime**: [Requires Login] Favourite or unfavourite an anime by its ID\n- **favourite_manga**: [Requires Login] Favourite or unfavourite a manga by its ID\n\n### People Tools\n- **get_character**: Get information about a character by their AniList ID\n- **get_staff**: Get information about staff member by their AniList ID\n- **favourite_character**: [Requires Login] Favourite or unfavourite a character by its ID\n- **favourite_staff**: [Requires Login] Favourite or unfavourite a staff member by their ID\n- **get_todays_birthday_characters**: Get all characters whose birthday is today\n- **get_todays_birthday_staff**: Get all staff members whose birthday is today\n\n### Recommendation Tools\n- **get_recommendation**: Get an AniList recommendation by its ID\n- **get_recommendations_for_media**: Get AniList recommendations for a specific media\n\n### Search Tools\n- **search_activity**: Search for activities on AniList\n- **search_anime**: Search for anime with query term and filters\n- **search_manga**: Search for manga with query term and filters\n- **search_character**: Search for characters based on a query term\n- **search_staff**: Search for staff members based on a query term\n- **search_studio**: Search for studios based on a query term\n- **search_user**: Search for users on AniList\n\n### Thread Tools\n- **get_thread**: Get a specific thread by its AniList ID\n- **get_thread_comments**: Get comments for a specific thread\n- **delete_thread**: [Requires Login] Delete a thread by its ID\n\n### User Tools\n- **get_user_profile**: Get a user's AniList profile\n- **get_user_stats**: Get a user's AniList statistics\n- **get_full_user_info**: Get a user's complete profile and stats information\n- **get_user_recent_activity**: Get recent activity from a user\n- **get_authorized_user**: [Requires Login] Get profile information of the currently authorized user\n- **follow_user**: [Requires Login] Follow or unfollow a user by their ID\n- **update_user**: [Requires Login] Update user settings\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Basic Anime Search\n\n```\nCan you search for anime similar to \"Bocchi the Rock!\"?\n```\n\n### Get Character Info\n\n```\nCan you tell me about the character Hitori Gotou?
