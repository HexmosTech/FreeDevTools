# runuser

> Run commands as a user and group without asking for password (needs root privileges).
> More information: <https://manned.org/runuser>.

- Run command as a different user:

`runuser {{user}} {{[-c|--command]}} '{{command}}'`

- Run command as a different user and group:

`runuser {{user}} {{[-g|--group]}} {{group}} {{[-c|--command]}} '{{command}}'`
