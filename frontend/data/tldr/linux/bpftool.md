# bpftool

> Inspect and manipulate eBPF programs and maps in a simple way.
> Some subcommands such as `prog` have their own usage documentation.
> More information: <https://manned.org/bpftool>.

- List information about loaded `eBPF` programs:

`bpftool prog list`

- List `eBPF` program attachments in the kernel networking subsystem:

`bpftool net list`

- List all active links:

`bpftool link list`

- List all `raw_tracepoint`, `tracepoint`, `kprobe` attachments in the system:

`bpftool perf list`

- List `BPF Type Format (BTF)` data:

`bpftool btf list`

- List information about loaded maps:

`bpftool map list`

- Probe a network device "eth0" for supported `eBPF` features:

`bpftool feature probe dev {{eth0}}`

- Run commands in batch mode from a file:

`bpftool batch file {{myfile}}`
