- Send local changes in the current branch to its default remote counterpart:

`git push`

- Send changes from a specific local branch to its remote counterpart:

`git push {{remote_name}} {{local_branch}}`

- Send changes from a specific local branch to its remote counterpart, and set the remote one as the default push/pull target of the local one:

`git push {{[-u|--set-upstream]}} {{remote_name}} {{local_branch}}`

- Send changes from a specific local branch to a specific remote branch:

`git push {{remote_name}} {{local_branch}}:{{remote_branch}}`

- Send changes on all local branches to their counterparts in a given remote repository:

`git push --all {{remote_name}}`

- Delete a branch in a remote repository:

`git push {{remote_name}} {{[-d|--delete]}} {{remote_branch}}`
