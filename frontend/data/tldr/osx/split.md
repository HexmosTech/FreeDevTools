# split

> Split a file into pieces.
> More information: <https://keith.github.io/xcode-man-pages/split.1.html>.

- Split a file, each split having 10 lines (except the last split):

`split -l 10 {{path/to/file}}`

- Split a file by a `regex`. The matching line will be the first line of the next output file:

`split -p {{cat|^[dh]og}} {{path/to/file}}`

- Split a file with 512 bytes in each split (except the last split; use 512k for kilobytes and 512m for megabytes):

`split -b 512 {{path/to/file}}`

- Split a file into 5 files. File is split such that each split has same size (except the last split):

`split -n 5 {{path/to/file}}`
