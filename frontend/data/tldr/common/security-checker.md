# security-checker

> Check if a PHP application uses dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
> More information: <https://github.com/sensiolabs/security-checker>.

- Look for security issues in the project dependencies (based on the `composer.lock` file in the current directory):

`security-checker security:check`

- Use a specific `composer.lock` file:

`security-checker security:check {{path/to/composer.lock}}`

- Return results as a JSON object:

`security-checker security:check --format=json`
