> Manage Go source code.
> Some subcommands such as `build` have their own usage documentation.
> More information: <https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go>.

- Download and install a package, specified by its import path:

`go get {{package_path}}`

- Compile and run a source file (it has to contain a `main` package):

`go run {{file}}.go`

- Compile a source file into a named executable:

`go build -o {{executable}} {{file}}.go`

- Compile the package present in the current directory:

`go build`

- Execute all test cases of the current package (files have to end with `_test.go`):

`go test`

- Compile and install the current package:

`go install`
