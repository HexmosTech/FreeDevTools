- Add a new user to a password file (will prompt to enter the password):

`mosquitto_passwd {{path/to/password_file}} {{username}}`

- Create the password file if it doesn't already exist:

`mosquitto_passwd -c {{path/to/password_file}} {{username}}`

- Delete the specified username instead:

`mosquitto_passwd -D {{path/to/password_file}} {{username}}`

- Upgrade an old plain-text password file to a hashed password file:

`mosquitto_passwd -U {{path/to/password_file}}`
