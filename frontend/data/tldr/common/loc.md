# loc

> Count lines of code. Written in Rust.
> More information: <https://github.com/cgag/loc>.

- Print lines of code in the current directory:

`loc`

- Print lines of code in the target directory:

`loc {{path/to/directory}}`

- Print lines of code with stats for individual files:

`loc --files`

- Print lines of code without .gitignore (etc.) files (e.g. two -u flags will additionally count hidden files and dirs):

`loc {{[-u|--unrestricted]}}`
