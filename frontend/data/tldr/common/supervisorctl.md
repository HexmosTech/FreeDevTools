- Show the status of a process (or all processes if `process_name` is not specified):

`supervisorctl status {{process_name}}`

- Start/stop/restart a process:

`supervisorctl {{start|stop|restart}} {{process_name}}`

- Start/stop/restart all processes in a group:

`supervisorctl {{start|stop|restart}} {{group_name}}:*`

- Show last 100 bytes of process `stderr`:

`supervisorctl tail -100 {{process_name}} stderr`

- Keep displaying `stdout` of a process:

`supervisorctl tail -f {{process_name}} stdout`

- Reload process configuration file to add/remove processes as necessary:

`supervisorctl update`
