# SEO Check List and Guideline

## Keyword Validation

### Finding the Correct Primary Keyword
A **primary keyword** is the main search term that users type into search engines to find the specific tool. It represents the core function of the tool and should match exactly what developers search for.

### Primary Keyword Formula
**Format**: `[Data/Format Type] + [Action/Tool Type]`

### Requirements Checklist:
- Primary keyword appears in title
- Keywords match user search intent
- No keyword stuffing (max 2-3% density)
- Uses related/synonym keywords naturally
- Keywords relevant to tool function

### Examples:

**✅ Good:**
- Primary: "datetime converter"  
- Secondary: ["timestamp converter", "UTC converter", "free date converter", "online datetime converter", "unix timestamp converter"]

**❌ Bad:**
- Primary: "time tool" (too vague)
- Secondary: ["tool", "helper", "utility", "thing", "converter"] (generic, keyword stuffing)

❌ if any fails: Keyword strategy needs optimization
Give a list of 5 SEO friendly keywords for the tool based on requirement

## Title Validation

- Format: [Tool Name] - [Primary Function]
- Length: 50-60 characters
- Keywords: Primary keyword in first 3 words
- Action words: Use verbs like Convert, Generate, Format, Validate, Create

### Examples:

**Good:**
- "JSON Formatter - Beautify & Validate JSON | Free DevTools" (59 chars)
- "Password Generator - Create Secure Passwords by Hexmos" (54 chars)
- "Date Converter - Transform UTC, ISO & Unix Times Free" (53 chars)

**Bad:**
- "JSON Tool for Developers Online" (missing brand, no action verb)
- "Free DevTools - The Best JSON Formatter Website Tool" (brand first, too long)
- "Password Generator" (too short, no brand)


❌ if any fails: Title needs optimization

## Meta Description Validation

### Format: `[Primary keyword action] with [Tool Name]`

- Length is 140-160 characters
- Contains primary keyword
- Contains 1 secondary keyword
- Has clear call-to-action

### Examples:

- "Format JSON data beautifully with JSON Formatter. Validate, minify, and beautify JSON instantly. Free online tool, no registration needed." (152 chars)

**Bad:**
- "This is a JSON tool that helps developers format their code" (no brand, no CTA, no primary keyword early)
- "Free DevTools by Hexmos offers the ultimate JSON formatting solution for all developers worldwide" (brand first, too generic, no CTA)


❌ if any fails: Rewrite meta description
Give optimized meta description based on requirement

## Heading Validation

### H1: Simple tool name (handled by ToolHead component)
- Format: `[Tool Name]` (e.g., "JSON Formatter", "Password Generator")

- Has exactly ONE H1 tag per page
- H1 contains primary keyword from title
- H1 describes main page purpose clearly

### Examples:

**Good**
- "JSON Formatter"
- "Password Generator" 

**Bad**
- "Free JSON Formatting Tool Online" (too long, keyword stuffing)
- "Tool for JSON" (vague, poor grammar)
- "JSON Formatter by Hexmos - Free Online Tool" (too long, brand in H1)

❌ if any fails: Rewrite heading
Give optimized heading based on requirement

## Heading Structure Check

- Has exactly ONE H1 tag
- H1 contains primary keyword from title
- Each H2 has different secondary keywords
- No skipped heading levels (H1→H3 without H2)

❌ if any fails: Fix heading structure
Give H1 and 4 H2 headings based on requirement

## Tool Description Validation

- Tool description exists on the page
- Length is 100-200 words
- Contains primary keyword in first sentence
- Contains 2-3 secondary keywords naturally
- Explains tool purpose clearly

### Examples:

**Good:**
"Instantly convert dates and times with Date Time Converter by Hexmos. Transform UTC, ISO, Unix, and more formats. Paste or pick a date to see all formats at once."

**Bad:**
"This tool converts dates and times. It's useful for developers who need to work with different formats. You can use it online for free."

**Security Tools**: OWASP guidelines, NIST standards


❌ if any fails: Add relevant high-quality external links

## Text-to-Code Ratio Validation

- Ensure the page has a healthy text-to-code ratio (recommended: at least 10% text content).
- Content should be at least 800 words for main tool pages.
- Add explanatory paragraphs, usage instructions, and educational content to increase text.
- Avoid pages that are mostly code or UI with minimal descriptive content.

❌ if any fails: Add more user-facing content, explanations, and relevant text to improve the ratio and meet minimum word count.
